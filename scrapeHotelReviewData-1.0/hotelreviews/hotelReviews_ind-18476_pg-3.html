ReviewText:Welp! For starters I read a few reviews about the lack of cleanliness of the rooms. When we checked in our room that was the first thing we noticed the surprisingly clean and fresh smelling room. The house keepers were very nice although the lack of English they spoke. The amenities needs work!! OMG you have to pay for parking $8 a day; and no continental breakfast. What type of "3 star" hotel doesn't have continental breaky? Any who; the hotel is nice walls are thin, needs upgrading but other that; it's awesome for the price.

ReviewText:The worst. Been here before, but this was a joke at check in. I waited in line for nearly 45 mins. Once I got to the counter - the did not have my reservation and this took another 15 mins. A big joke.

ReviewText:Our flight got in late and we were tired. The Hacienda was close to the airport and easy to find. When we arrived, it was clean and there were lots of details that made it obvious it was well-kept. The room was comfortable and the entire experience was pleasant.

ReviewText:I have stayed at this hotel twice now and have really enjoyed it. I really enjoy the d√©cor and environment of the hotel.The second time I stayed there, the room was very small, with a terrible view of hotel machinery and was located right near the stairwell which I did not like. However, my prior experience I had a big and comfortable room. The staff were very nice and the parking lots were big and right next door.

ReviewText:Was picking up my daughter at LAX to visit UCLA. Needed a good value basic room for 2 nights. The pace was clean and comfortable. A little worn on the outside but rooms were well maintained.

ReviewText:This is a very busy hotel near LAX. The first room smelled of cat urine and was quickly changed. The second room did not have a working heater, but it didn't smell! Restaurants right across the street. It was good for getting to the airport early.
