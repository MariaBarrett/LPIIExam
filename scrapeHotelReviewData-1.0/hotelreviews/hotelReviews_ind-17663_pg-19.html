ReviewText:Very, very pleased! Hotel room was spacious, extremely clean, and quiet. There was a decent size pool and small fitness center. Staff was pleasant and TV had cable, including HBO and other good channels. Also, great location! Ventura Blvd (just up the street) has TONS of restaurants, stores, and bars. We explored several parts of LA, including Hollywood and Santa Monica, and went to Universal Studios with no problem getting around. We would definitely stay at the Carriage Inn Best Western next time we're in town.

ReviewText:For the price and the limited time we were in the hotel, we had a good stay. Other reviews warning of parking issues proved to be true. The room was smaller than others we've stayed in and the bathroom was tiny. It was clean and well maintained and in a good location for the places we were going.

ReviewText:Hotel was convenient to many highways. We traveled to many different parts of Los Angeles so the hotel location was great! The staff was friendly and helpful. Only thing that would have made this hotel perfect would have been a free breakfast.

ReviewText:The place was good because there was a gas station across the street and a Denny's right in the area. The only downfall is that there was a discount for customers that stayed in the hotel, but I was not informed by the staff about the discount. The room was clean and the place was quiet. The free parking and roominess of the parking lot was great. The bed was comfortable besides the pillows. The couch looked old and dirty, did not want to relax on it. No free breakfast for the high price. The staff was nice and friendly.

ReviewText:I was very happy with my stay. Rooms were clean, the property was very well kept, and it was nice having a Denny's on the property. The only downside if there is one is that our room was in a hall and we could here the louder people walking in the halls in our room and some slight road noise.
