ReviewText:We were impressed with all of our experiences at the facility.  Our 12yr old grandaughter sure was overwhelmed with the service and the food.

ReviewText:Well located for downtown stays. Didnt utilise many facilities but the room service experience was very good. Room basic and a bit unusual but comfortable and functional.  Small bathroom with an over bath shower. Lobby and public areas were a very grand step back in time.

ReviewText:Hotel check-in was a breeze.  Didn't like the price of valet at the hotel, considering there are definitely cheaper options within walking distance of the hotel. -newline-  -newline- Upon entering the room, it was dark and no light switches were on the wall.  I had to crack open the door to let some hallway light in to find the closest lamp.  The room was lit up strictly by lamps.  No free Wi-Fi; it costs $10, I'm glad I brought my Wi-Fi card. -newline-  -newline- But for the historical background of the hotel, friendly staff, and decent location I would stay again.

ReviewText:I really enjoyed my stay at the Biltmore. I work at a fashion market in downtown LA so it is very conveniently located to where I need to be for work. It is within walking distance to the market and has neighboring convenience stores and restaurants.

ReviewText:The hotel is beautiful, the service was superb, the bar and restaurant were elegant with good food and nice selection of wine and drinks.  A first class experience all the way.  Probably the best downtown hotel I've ever experienced.  The staff in particular is warm, attentive, and went out of their way to be helpful in big and small ways.  Only complaint:  parking and internet are expensive.

ReviewText:I waited 2 hours at time of checking in.I had to call Orbitz to try to fix the problem.My reservation was not made.At time of checking out same situation the hotel gave me a bill for my staying.I had to contact Orbitz again. The hotel stuff was rude.  They said that was my problem because I used a  third party to reserve the room. I was very disappointed in the way the hotel stuff handled the situation. Orbits never send my paperwork for my reservation to  the hotel.I do not understand why I had a confirmation number,my card was charged and the reservation was not there upon my arrival.

ReviewText:I enjoyed my hotel stay. The rooms were clean and the staff was very nice. The valet parking was a bit expensive and the room upgrade was also expensive since our upgrade room was surprisingly small. We stayed on the club level 10 where there was a club lounge. The "complimentary" drinks consisted of cheap wine. The "continental" breakfast consisted of fruit and danishes.

ReviewText:This is the Grande Dame of LA hotels, in the heart of the historic downtown (yes, LA has history people) district on Pershing Square and a block or two from the main financial centers as well as city hall and the library.  Having stayed at a number of other hotels in this hood on business, this is my favorite place by far. -newline-  -newline- The Staples Center, Little Tokyo, Chinatown, and Olivera Street are not far away.
