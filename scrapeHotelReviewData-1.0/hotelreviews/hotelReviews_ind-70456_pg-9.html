ReviewText:It was a fabulous stay!  Our primary reason for visiting LA was to see Oprah's After Oscar Show at the Kodak theater.  To make things easier, we wanted to stay close.  After reviewing numerous hotels in the area, the Roosevelt seemed to be the best choice.  The staff was super friendly and offered an Oscar Viewing Party in the historical lobby on the first day.  The service was great and we had a wonderful time.  I would highly recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:The hotel itself was nice, but I rather stay at a Holiday in because they at least don't charge you for every little thing. For how much I paid I should have gotten at least free WiFi. The room was very small and I couldn't even order movies on the tv. I was kinda disappointed because I was told that it was a good hotel. I am normally not picky at all when I stay places, but I just felt that for the money I paid I could have gotten much better.

ReviewText:Some "cabana rooms" are overlooking a street and the Hotel chose to have the windows frosted. My husband and I asked to be moved to a room with a clear window. The staff was helpful and we ended up in a cabana room with balcony overlooking the pool, which was great! We enjoyed drinking our coffee in the morning in our private balcony above the pool. The only thing to note is that the pool bar is a trendy bar so it plays loud music until 2AM in the weekends. Not family friendly but it didn't bother us. All in all, a good hotel with a good location if you choose the room that fits your style. We will probably stay there again in the future.

ReviewText:I've stayed at the Roosevelt over six times in the past few months, and find it a great place to stay for business.  The fittness center is small, clean, well equipped and almost always empty. If you work out in the morning, often there is a pot of fresh coffee outside the fittness center at the ready. I always stay in the cabana rooms (either garden or pool view)which are decent sized and sound-proofed much better than other hotels in the same price/sytle category.  If you stay in the cabana rooms on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday evening during good weather and are looking for a quiet getaway, the poolside rooms aren't for you as the Tropicana Bar is often booked for events which can last well into the early hours.  The garden view rooms, however, are always quiet as they face residential blocks of Hollywood. -newline- The staff at the Roosevelt is always friendly and accomodating, even if they do not recognize you as a return guest.  The valets and door staff, on the other hand, are some of the best!  They are incredibly personable and professional.

ReviewText:Web site was misleding on size of room. I needed to have space for meetings and had to upgrade at an additional $125per night to do so. -newline-  -newline- There always seemed to be a party going on in the hallways and I had to listen to a flute player practice for quite some time one evening. -newline-  -newline- Staff that led you away from activites in the lobby were not rude, but a bit forcefull. Made me feel like it was my fault the lobby was closed. -newline-  -newline- Bathroom layout is poor and the old tub is very slippery. The glass partition is the only thing to try and catch yourself. -newline-  -newline- I could understand the high parking price if your not a guest. -newline-  -newline- Maintenace had to drill out the door in order to get me in my room. Then they had to come back and replace lockset. I was offered another room, but it was the small king that I had just upgraded from. -newline-  -newline- I would have thought that after sitting in the hallway waiting for maintenance to let me in and then being distrubed again while they re-installed a new lockset that some form of compensation would have been offered...none was.

ReviewText:While I loved staying in the middle of Hollywood, I was very disappointed with the Roosevelt Hotel.  The furniture in my upgraded "suite" was falling apart and the iPod dock clock radio was completely out of commission.  If I'm paying a premium rate for a room I expect a premium experience, this was not the case.  Look to The Standard.

ReviewText:We were told by the desk staff when we first arrived that they would do us a favor and upgrade us to a deluxe room from the standard we had paid for, but [...] had verified a Deluxe room already for us.  I didn't say anything about it when they gave us this apparent upgrade.We were let into our room quite early, since occupancy was not all that busy.The room had plenty of space, but nowhere to sit other than the bed and one small desk chair.  When I mentioned this at check-out, the desk person said there certainly should have been additional seating in the room and that when I came the next time, I could ask for more seating if none was provided.  Somehow, it doesn't seem to me that it should be my responsibility to make sure they are providing the proper amenities in their rooms.  I was not offered any compensation for the inconvenience we endured by the lack of seating in the room.
