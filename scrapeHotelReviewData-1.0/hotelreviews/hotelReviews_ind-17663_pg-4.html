ReviewText:Hotel didn't have water between 10pm and 5am for the three nights we stayed. -newline-  -newline- On the last morning we didn't have hot water in 3 of the rooms. Hotel staff did set up another room for us to shower but at that point 2 of us couldn't shower because there wasn't enough time as we had to leave for airport.

ReviewText:Conveniently located off 405. Short distance from the Getty center. When arrived we asked for non smoking room. The room nevertheless smelled. The receptionist immediately switched us to another room which was just fine. The place clean and spacious.

ReviewText:This hotel is in a good location and has a cheap rate. While the room was somewhat clean, it often smelled of smoke and there were ants in some areas. I also found a cracker and sucker in the desk drawer that hadn't been clean. The pool/spa area was just OK and the gym was minimal. It's great that Denny's is in the parking lot. -newline-  -newline- All of that said, it wasn't a horrible experience. It's a great location if you need to stay in the Los Angeles/Burbank/North Hollywood area. It's right off several highways. There's a Target down the road, along with some fast food restaurants. South of the hotel, there is also a mall with some eateries, which I didn't notice until our last day. -newline-  -newline- The staff was accommodating. -newline-  -newline- If you are looking for a cheap place to just lay your head at night, this is it.

ReviewText:Visiting relatives. Hotel was nearby and also close to major thoroughfares, shopping and dining. No problems at all. Cleaning staff was thorough and dependable. Plenty of parking and a Denny's on the premises that provided a 10% discount when I showed my room key.
