ReviewText:Great location, nice morning light looking at LA Public Library. Quiet. -newline-  -newline- But, bath tub wouldn't switch to shower. Bathroom much colder than bedroom. -newline-  -newline- Coffee for two total $17 because in-room coffee couldn't be made because we first couldn't get the coffee open, then opened it too much.

ReviewText:Everyone on staff was incredibly helpful and pleasant. I was disappointed that there was no microwave or refrig in the room. I felt the room service was very expensive for what we ordered, however, that could just be L.A.

ReviewText:It is an absolutely beautiful hotel with lovely amenities, such as a bar and restaurant.  Many other venues near by, within 3-4 blocks walking distant.  They were very nice to give us an extra room after I had booked a 2 queen room and when we arrived were told that they only had Kings left.  Needless to say, traveling with a business associate this was not going to work.  [...].In town for the Gift Show -
