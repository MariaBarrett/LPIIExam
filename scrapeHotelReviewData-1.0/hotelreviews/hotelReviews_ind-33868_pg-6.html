ReviewText:The location was spectacular, and for the price, unbeatable... [...]  Walking distance to Rodeo Drive, and right in the middle for traveling to business meetings in the area.  The lounge and bar area when you first walk in is very nice for casual business meetings.  Rooms are set up with all the conveniences needed  and comfortable king size beds.  Free wifi at the pool!

ReviewText:I've stayed at the Beverly Hilton before for business and was quite impressed with it several years ago, so when I saw such a great price (about $200 per night, all in) for a quick weekend trip to LA I jumped on it.  Overall, it's held up quite well. -newline-  -newline- Service is wonderful, which I expect from this caliber hotel in Beverly Hills.  My husband and I were 20 minutes late for breakfast service and the hostess was nice enough to let us order breakfast anyway, even though the restaurant at Trader Vic's was closed. -newline-  -newline- Rooms are a little on the small side, but very well appointed (outside of our slightly awkward bathroom) and comfortable, including the nice, big, comfy, soft bed and flat screen TV.  The pool area is slightly small, but I like that sort of thing, and has lots of chairs in both sunny and shady areas with very attentive poolside service.  I especially like how the pool is enclosed, so you don't see or hear road traffic and it makes it sort of oasis-like.  Oh, and the gym is awesome.  Nice new equipment, all cardio machines have their own TV, with a well-stocked weights area. -newline-  -newline- It's in a great location, almost within (I say that because no one walks anywhere in LA, even though I'd totally do it) walking distance to Rodeo Drive. -newline-  -newline- All in all, if you have a chance to stay here, do it. Well worth it.

ReviewText:Great place but man will you ever pay MORE than you think.  They get you on the small stuff.  $30 a day parking, $15 a day internet, $10 for a bottle of water, etc.  Friendly staff and great facility but don't think you are getting a deal when you book online.  They get you.

ReviewText:Overall we were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Everyone knows it by name, but the first impression upon entry wasn't much to see. However, once you enter into the turnabout you get a substantially different image and appreciation of the location. The renovation work in the main entry and common areas was excellent. -newline- We stayed in the Oasis side and not the tower, but we had no problems with the room at a lower cost. -newline- The only drawback was that we should have checked into the event schedule of the hotel, because there was a "Hollywood" event that totally blockedup the entry and also left the parking garage virtually useless for regular hotel guests.
