ReviewText:Over all was really great.  However, buffet was not very good for the price charged. Food was not hot and never is with buffet. Selection not very good for people who do not like sushi. Very little meat selection. Lots of seafood selection, but not very good. If you drink expect to pay dearly for those drinks, they are quite pricey, but to be expected for the location and quality of hotel. I would bring a microwave if you plan on eating in. You can get a comp refrigerator.  Pet friendly but $75 for the stay. If you plan on bringing your pet don't expect a room with a view. Pet owners are relagated to the 2nd floor below the lobby. You pay $9.95 a day for the luxary bedding whether you want it or not.  Unexpected cost until reservation was made. If you make online, read the fine print.  Will probably stay somewhere else next time we come down. Would like to be treated with a little more respect as a responsible pet owner. Expect to pay a minimum of $10 tip for services provided by bellpersons and to Vallai persons parking.  Vallai parking was worth the price paid per night, which to me was worth it to not have to hassle parking the car ourselves and having the convenice of loading the car right in front rather than drag it on several trips to the self parking garage. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

ReviewText:Attend the Ellen show which was not very good!!! The hotel was great and very friendly atmosphere but thought it was a little costly for the room we had. I do travel around and have stayed at hotels that have the same setup for a lot less.  I did like that they provide shuttles and this was a plus but had to find out on our own. It would be nice to know that the staff would have informed us of the shuttles when we arrived.  But did enjoy the stay and the bar was great with good prices on the food and drinks.

ReviewText:Loved the location. There are great restaurants and good shopping walking distance from the hotel. Then there's universal studios. The hotel was clean and the service was great. Just thought the carpet could have been cleaner but great bathroom and cleaning service.

ReviewText:From the moment we arrived, the staff was most accommodating and gracious! We were treated to a delicious fruit basket, which was brought to our room. We really enjoyed being so near Universal Studios and CityWalk and would recommend the Hilton Universal to all.
