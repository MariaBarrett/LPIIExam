ReviewText:There is NO WAY this hotel is 4 stars! I was so disappointed! The hotel is old and in desperate need for renovation. -newline-  -newline- The lobby is beautiful, I would even give it 5 stars! However, the rooms are beyond bad, so I would rate the rooms at 2 stars. Maybe the hotel received its 4 star rating by taking the average of the 5 star lobby and the 2 star rooms. -newline-  -newline- The rooms are small, old, dusty, and nothing in them is upgraded. The bathroom tile is the cheapest small white tile (like in a public restroom). The shower is tiny and resembles a cheap motel shower. Even the toilet paper is of the cheapest thinnest and roughest kind. They don't even put brand new toilet paper rolls when you first get the room. Additionally, the sheets are not good. Instead of using a duvet - sheet for the comforter, they use regular sheets which don't cover the comforter well and your body basically touches a comforter which who knows how many people have slept in (the comforter also does not smell well). I was a bit disgusted from that experience. -newline-  -newline- Finally, some (not all) of the staff was unfriendly. At check-in, I was welcomed by a sassy receptionist - she was full of attitude. I would prefer to be welcomed with a smile and friendly demeanor. -newline-  -newline- I would not recommend staying at this hotel. It is not worth the price. It may be nice to visit for an event, check out the lobby and the restaurants, but don't stay in the rooms.

ReviewText:This is the type of classic hotel everyone should experience at least once on a vacation. The vaulted ceilings and gilded hallways, as well as the gurgling fountain and crystal chandeliers bring to mind the great old hotels that hosted the truly talented artists from days gone by. -newline- The Millenium was our base as we explored the Los Angeles region. When we returned from Malibu, Universal Studios and other sightseeing venues, it was a delight to step into the Millenium's embrace. We especially enjoyed the Lounge with its complimentary breakfast and evening hor d'heurves. The wait staff was exceptional as was the concierge who helped us plan some of our excursions.

ReviewText:The hotel is really pretty and photo worthy. You should walk around and enjoy the scenery and architecture too. The standard rooms were fine considering we only slept there and showered. My only thing are the shower heads though, but it seems like most hotels have the same issue. It seems like there is crusty white stuff on the shower head probably from not cleaning after the multiple uses. The rooms are a little used, but decent for sleeping and showering, so a 3.5-4 stars. There is a pool and exercise room, just ask someone there and they'll let you know where it is. There are towels and don't forget your room keys. We were charged $50 for incidentals because we told the front desk we do not want anything except to sleep and to void extra things such as WiFi. We also didn't eat there, but there are a lot of bus stops around that can easily take you anywhere, just use Google maps to determine the bus stop you need to where you want to go and it would be easier with a smart phone. The normal buses go for $1.50 and the DASH buses go for 50 cents. The staff were really nice, so no need to yell at them for your own problems (we've seen a number of people take their anger out on them, which I found completely unnecessary.) We walked around and went to store, the library (which I found so cool), lunch/dinner, etc. Nice hotel, decent room, good location and a nice stay if you can get it for a good price ahead of time.

ReviewText:THE PUBLIC AREAS OF THIS HOTEL ARE MAGNIFICENT... THE RESTAURANTS, TEAROOM AND LOBBY ARE GREAT FOR SHORT TO MEDIUM LENGTH BUSINESS MEETINGS. -newline- THIS TIME I PAID TO STAY ON THE CLUB FLOOR. I INFORMED THE FRONT DESK THAT MY ROOM WAS MUSTY AND IT WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE REMOTE I HAD, TO TURN THE TV ON AND OFF. -newline- THEY DID NOT MANAGE TO RECTIFY EITHER OF THESE PROBLEMS; EVEN THOUGH I WAS TOLD TWICE IT WOULD BE DONE. FURTHERMORE, EVEN THOUGH I HAD SIGNIFICANT CHARGES AT CHECKOUT; WHEN I TOLD THE CASHIER THESE ISSUES WERE NEVER RESOLVED, I WAS NOT OFFERED ANY SAVINGS OFF MY EXPENDITURES. -newline- I THINK THETY CLEARLY NEED SOME HOUSEKEEPING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING, -newline- I WILL SY THE AMENITIES OF THE CLUB LOUNFGE WERE WELL WORTH THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE.

ReviewText:The room was good overall with the exception of the bathroom. The bathroom was simply too small.

ReviewText:This is a beautiful hotel. It is worth the money. The hotel has historical old feel. The afternoon tea reminded me of the Plaza, New York City.

ReviewText:Beautiful hotel with tons of history in a great location. Pleasant and knowledgable staff, especially the concierge on duty on Sun Jul 28. She advised us on which tour to choose and booked the right one. Her advise on Universal was on the ball! Four days in LA well spent!!

ReviewText:Absolutely stunning historic hotel. Comfortable. It is near metro station which makes it easy to get to places like Hollywood. I had a standard room. It was nice and comfortable but nothing really flashy. -newline-  -newline- Staff were very welcoming and helpful. -newline-  -newline- The Hotel is located in down town LA which is not meant to be the safest place. I walked around a bit but not much. Didn't feel uncomfortable but as a tourist you need to be a little street wise. I was there on the 4 July so it was pretty quite and there were lots of police especially at the metro station. -newline-  -newline- Word of warning. If you have a car it will cost you $40 per day.

ReviewText:Thoroughly enjoyed the ambience of the hotel as it is a preserved historic building especially the lobby, bar and ballrooms. However because of this, the actual suites could use some remodelling as well as the gym area and locker room. One thing that I thought should have been included is wi-fi. Internet, business centre services like printing a couple of pages etc. all were extra charges and phone call rates were very expensive. These services except phone should be part of the package.
