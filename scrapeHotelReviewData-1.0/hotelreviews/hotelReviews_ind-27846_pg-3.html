ReviewText:Well let me start off by fully admitting I'm giving this hotel a poor rating for an event that ultimately is my fault, but I believe others may benefit from being warned. During a recent Christmas shopping trip, I stayed overnight at this Holiday Inn in Burbank based upon the recommendation of a friend. Upon retiring for the night, I dumped the contents of my purse, including receipts, credit cards, cash, medicine and checkbook in the nightstand drawer. Sadly, I also placed my wedding set and other jewelry in the drawer too. When I checked-out, I neglected to remove my things and didn't realize it until today. Upon calling back to the hotel front desk, I was told the only items turned in by the maid were a checkbook, medicine, and a credit card (conveniently things no one else can safely use/sell). The hotel staff seemed VERY uninterested in my loss and/or the implication. I have filed police and insurance reports but Iâ€™m surprised that Holiday Inn would be so nonchalant about having a thief as an employee. Outside of the five-figure loss, the hotel was okay. If this comes to a happy resolution, I will update the review.

ReviewText:My stay at the Holiday Inn-Burbank Media Center was great except that when we went to check in we were told that the rooms we booked through the online travel company were oversold and that they didn't have any rooms availalble for us. The manager had to scramble to find us 2 rooms and tried to give us standard beds even though we asked for King size beds. It took about 30 minutes to get everything sorted out but nonetheless a bit of an inconvenience. The rooms are very spacious, quiet (can't hear anyone above you) and clean although they could do some updating with the carpet and paint. They have a few restaurants onsite which are also very good and they offer free parking. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall, I would definitely stay there again.

ReviewText:Worst hotel I've ever stayed in... Location was great but the staff was horrible! Asked nicely if we can upgrade to a suite for a bigger space, to have a bigger room to get ready for a wedding the next day, but flatly said no right away without even Checking if there's -newline- Any room available... Im willing to pay for it but the way they answered was really rude and customer service was bad...We dealt with it and went straight to this old room... Bathroom had too much lights that can blind someone... Then requested for some chairs to be brought up to our room so when we start our hair and make up session so people can sit but said they have no chairs!!! Really?!' can't we borrow from the hall with 300 chairs? Flatly said no! I really -newline- Should've checked in to residence inn Marriott instead... The bell boys were nice but staff in the desk were really bad! I would not recommend this hotel...

ReviewText:I needed to be near some specific entertainment studios, and this place was right there, perfect. I got an incredible deal when I booked air/car/flight. The bed was really comfortable, the room was clean, the lobby was recently re-modeled (I stayed before in 2006) I will stay there next time! The room had pictures from the 80's, but who cares, I love the 80's and also a great deal.

ReviewText:I had planned a spontaneous 2 days 1 night getaway to LA and I literally booked my room the morning that I was leaving for LA. Not only was the staff accommodating and understanding,the hotel was gorgeous! I was expecting the Holiday Inn to be a 3 star (max) hotel but after arriving,the place was stunning. I loved how it is conveniently across the street from local bars/restaurants like BJ's. This is definitely placed in a great location. Overall,I think I just might have to stay with the Holiday Inn whenever I'm in LA.Completely satisfied:)))

ReviewText:Very impressed. I was pleasantly surprised with this hotel in Burbank. Everything was arranged correctly through the reservation system, and the King-Suite was spacious and comfortable. The room was clean and the linens smelled like they just came out of the dryer. Nice location in terms of safety and Highway access. If traveling through the Los Angeles area, give them a try.

ReviewText:Well-situated property with easy access to Burbank amenities. Not great for business travel. More of a family hotel.
