ReviewText:great hotel. the bed was so comfortable. stuff member are nice. but i dont feel they are very friendly. our room has a door to the other room, so if people next door talk loud, we can hear it. and las night, there were some drunk people screaming next door. we could not fall asleep. we called the front desk and the security went to talk to them, it was efficient.

ReviewText:This hotel is probably in the best location as far as being very close to everything and is a short walk nearly everywhere. Better be 40 years or younger as there is plenty of young people that dance and sing in the hallways until 4 AM every night! Great eye candy around the pool during the day for either sex, but better have a fat wallet to pay the bill for beverages and food. Staff was awesome, and we traded our room without to much fuss. Nice upgrades to building but definitely no more than 3 stars

ReviewText:We got to the hotel around 6pm on a Saturday and after checking in, we were looking for a place to eat. The concierge recommended a seafood place and since we hadn't been to L.A. in over 10 years, we went for it. While the food was very good, it was overpriced and not the environment we had told her we wanted (fun, lively, etc. This restaurant was much more dull). -newline-  -newline- On the morning we checked out, I called ahead so the car would be ready. Unfortunately, I had to ask three separate people to get our car, which finally pulled up after close to 45 minutes after my original call. -newline-  -newline- Aside from those two issues, the hotel is in a great spot for site seeing and the lobby/bar was wonderful. The bed was very comfortable.

ReviewText:Beautiful hotel with great dining options. Rooms a decent size - only disappointing part of the visit was my first room was obviously close to the club as from 11 pm I could here music thumping; changing rooms took over an hour (which seemed like forever as I was very tired) and the next room they gave me stank of smoke so I had to move again (hence the 3 stars rather than 4). No business center. Great pool area.

ReviewText:Very nice stay. The pool area and bar are great and one of the best people watching spots you'll find. The Garden/Pool rooms are under renovation and the job they are doing is top class. Internet is spotty (at best) in those rooms, but that may just be because they are not finished with all the work (as of 4/1/2011).

ReviewText:Overall, the experience was pretty good. We stayed for 3 nites. Great location right across the street from the Kodak Theatre, Wax Museum, Chinese Theatre - that's the plus. Older, classic hotel - dark accents, style.  Hotel is a bit "stuffy" - real Hollywood, LA-ish. When we inquired about nightclubs in the area, we were told by the Concierge that "well, we have one of the best in our hotel, but I don't think you guys can get it!"

ReviewText:I decided to come to this hotel because it is a classic hotel in downtown Hollywood and it is in the center of everything. When I arrived to the hotel I was told that the room that I had booked had been oversold and that I was going to be upgraded to a room that was attached to the penthouse. This room had no glasses to make mixed drinks, poor lighting, and things seemed to be ripped or stained in regards to the furniture. We were told that it should be a quiet night because the penthouse had not been booked for that night. When the morning came, at 9am there was loud music and banging on the door. I called downstairs and they said that they would call them as well as I went to the door and told them to turn down the music which they did not. It was overall a decent experience although these things did put a few bumps in the road.
