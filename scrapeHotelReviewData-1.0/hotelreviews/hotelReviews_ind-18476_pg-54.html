ReviewText:What's not to like at the Hacienda? Have stayed there many times and it is great value.  Could do with a little work on its air conditioning for the warmer months, but we like it just the way it is.

ReviewText:We live about 40 miles from the airport so to avoid the stress of a very early morning drive, we stayed at the Hacienda. We didn't need anything fancy, but it was clean, efficient, and friendly. The free van to the airport was worth it all.

ReviewText:The overall experience was satiifactory for us.  The hotel was a bit run down.  When we left in the morning, one of the elevators that were already very old and slow broke down.  People were stuck in the hallway with luggages.  Lucky for us we left our luggage in the car, so we just took the stairs down.

ReviewText:I participated in the hotels park and fly program.  I stayed at the hotel the night before my trip, and parked my car at the hotel lot for 5 nights.  The lot was well lit and secure.  The value was excellent.      All other aspects of the hotel met my needs perfectly. The restaurant is very good.      I would hightly recommend this hotel to my friends.

ReviewText:We arrived early in the morning (6am) at the Hacienda Hotel, El Segundo, California and were immediately given a room.  We had been traveling for two days without a hotel and were so pleased to be able to get to our room and shower right away.  We had a 7:30 breakfast date with our grandson so being able to freshen up was very much appreciated.     The shuttle service, both to and from the airport and to local shopping areas was the best.   Our room was pleasant and well taken care of.  We would definitely stay here again if the opportunity presented itself.

ReviewText:Overall I liked the location and the amenities. However, parking was at best inadequate. Plus the air took too long to cool the room. I also think that a nicer TV should be part of your standard equipment. I think the staff was quite friendly and helpful, and dining was excellent.

ReviewText:The hotel staff was helpful and considerate.  For values for the money in the LAX area I would say it hit the target nicely
