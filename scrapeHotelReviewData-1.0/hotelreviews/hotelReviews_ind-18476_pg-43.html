ReviewText:The halls, stairway, and elevator had a kinda bad smell going on. The elevator was super tiny. However, the room was okay. It wasn't a horrible place, but not anything to write home about either.

ReviewText:A refrigerator is an essential.  Thus I will make sure that with future bookings the room has a refrigerator, or one is available.  Further I will not book again with a hotel with such small rooms.  For what we got the price paid was excessive.

ReviewText:Looking at pictures of the hotel I thought I was getting a good deal for what I paid.  It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't great either. I was put in a smoking room when I requested non-smoking but the hotel staff was extremely polite and accommodating. The parking lot was always full so that was annoying.  All in all it was an ok hotel but you could probably find something nicer for the same price.

ReviewText:We have stayed at the Hacienda several times.  Always happy with the rooms and service.  However, this time we encountered a few problems.  One of the outlets in our room didn't work and couldn't be fixed during our stay.  The heat lamp in the bathroom had slipped out of its base and was just hanging by the wires.  The parking lots were always full and the entry gate didn't always work.  But, as I said - this is the only time we've had any problems.  The staff is always helpful and friendly.  The coffee shop is great - good breakfasts.  We would stay there again.

ReviewText:Shuttles do not run on a specific schedule and it takes a long time for an airport pickup.  Schedule from the Hotel to airport is more predictable.

ReviewText:Met my son for a Dodger game. The two patio areas have lots of outdoor seating with chairs, tables, sofa sets, heaters, fireplace, water fountain and lots of foliage. Plenty of room for lots of people and very relaxing.The dinner was very good and the people were friendly. The ambiance was wonderful
