ReviewText:First thing was I booked the room months before and specifically asked for a room on a high floor (12 or above)I e-mailed and called once before arrival stating the same. Sure enough I was put on the 5th floor. When I requested a room change I was denied without any concern at all. I had also signed up for gold service prior to the stay and was supposed to fet all these wonderful extras like complimentary water the night of the arrival, comp beverage service and newspaper in the morning. Didn't happen until I phoned about each item. We even asked for water the night before at the front desk and they said there wasn't any at that time except to purchase in the very small store.The next morning only when checking out was the front desk person appologetic about what had happened. Then when I went to get the car from valet they seemed to forget me until I had to request a second time for my car about 15 minutes later.

ReviewText:The room was clean. Great view of the plaza below. Checking in was painless.  Valet parking cost $30 per night.  Valet was quick to take and return your car when needed. Everything worked inside the room like it should.  The tub and stand-up shower was separate which was nice.

ReviewText:We made a good choice in choosing the Omni Hotel in Los Angeles. It is in a very good location close to transport.   The room was comfortable and clean and the staff excellent.  The Concierge on duty couldn't have been more helpful.  We would stay there again.

ReviewText:I stayed for a long weekend, Saturday through Tuesday.  The staff is very friendly; the location is super quiet at night; Disney Hall and the Cathedral are a short walk; the food at the hotel is delicious; there's a patio outside with fire-pit tables, right in the middle of the LA skyline; the red line subway is one block away, so it's easy to get to Hollywood and back fast and cheap. It was a totally relaxing getaway.

ReviewText:First of all, this place is not toddler friendly. Every room in this high rise has a window that easily unlatches about 2-3 feet from the floor, and with no protective barrier whatsoever. A young child can easily climb through and fall. We weren't happy about this when we were given a room on the 8th floor with our very active 2 year-old curious about the street below. [...]Our rooms weren't cleaned one of the days, even though someone came in for evening turndown service. All in all, I've stayed in motels that have more class. Stay here if you must, but be prepared to be treated according to how much you pay. Also, be prepared to pay an insane amount for daily parking.

ReviewText:Great service. I stayed on the 16th floor (the Omni Club) and had the benefit of getting a few free perks including breakfast, free use of the business center (although when I called reception I was told to use the business center on the 1st floor and ended up having to pay for my own internet-my only gripe), shoe shine, etc. Very nice hotel for business stay.
