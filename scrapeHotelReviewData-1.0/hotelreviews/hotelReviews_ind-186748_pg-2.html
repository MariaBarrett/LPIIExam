ReviewText:The hotel was really nice. The rooms was huge and the breakfast was great. Kind of expensive but you should expect that with this type of hotel. The only thing I didn't like was the 35 dollar valet fee. Why should you pay to park your car if you are staying in the hotel. Other than that its a great hotel.

ReviewText:The hotel is located quietly away from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood and it felt very exclusive. The rooms were amazing! It was huge, with a super comfortable bed and large bathroom. The sink and complimentary coffee and water was nice. It was one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at and we would love to go back to celebrate our next wedding anniversary! We dined at The London, which was the best restaurant experience. The food was perfect and the atmosphere was unforgettable!

ReviewText:Our stay at the London was very satisfying overall.  The property is absolutely stunning and they have done a complete renovation.  Check in was very easy .They upgraded us to a corner room.  The service at the pool was very friendly and fast except both days that we used the pool our server left  for the day without letting us settle our tab or submitting our last order. My only real complaint is when we requested a late check out they charged us the half day rate.   If a room is not needed and a guest wants to hang around (and spend money at the pool) I don't see why it's good business to charge extra.
