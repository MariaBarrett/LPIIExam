ReviewText:The Hacienda Hotel is clean, reasonably priced and relatively close to LAX.  I wanted a place to sleep between flights and it served that purpose adequately.  The breakfast in its restaurant was good and what I would have ordered (eggs, sausage and toast) if I had had a choice.  Their shuttle service was excessively slow.  I had to wait more than 30 minutes for pick up, watching the shuttle buses for other hotels go by.

ReviewText:The common areas of this hotel are quite beautiful.  It was nice having an attached restaraunt and lots of other restaraunts and a grocery store within a short walk.  The rest of the hotel is very old and very much in need of renovations.  I noticed a lot of mold/mildew in the bathrooms, on ceilings, etc. so if you suffer allergies this is probably not the place for you.

ReviewText:I love everything about the hotel except the transportation shuttles.  They did not stop at the LAX bus station or the Aviation Metro Train station.  I wish they had a shuttle stop at the Metro Train station so guests like me can hop a bus to Santa Monica or go to Downtown LA via train.  It would be a nice option to advertise to the guest at the hotel.

ReviewText:I was so disappointed in this Hotel and would not recommend it to anyone. They were not accommodating at all and to have had to pay to park in their parking lot was absurd! The Hotel was in shambles and the door did not lock properly so I had to stick a chair under the doorknob in fear that someone would break in. I did not sleep at all that night and will never try this Hotel ever again. I will go back to Hampton Inn where I know the room is clean and the doors lock properly.

ReviewText:If you are looking for sleek and modern, go elsewhere. This hotel has a special charm. It reminded me of the song "Hotel California" but it was easy to check in and out. I liked the Spanish decor and surroundings. My children didn't like the hotel. They did not appreciate the ambience. This hotel would be a nice place for a romantic get away. Go dancing downstairs cha cha etc and then get a room for the night.

ReviewText:This was a comfortable and affordable place to relax in between legs of my journey.  The place smelled a bit old and musty but the rooms were clean and comfortable and you get lots of amenities for such a low price.  Good breakfast, too!

ReviewText:The Hacienda is a perfect overnighter for LAX. It's inexpensive and has some character but it's still reasonably clean and well ordered. They get you to and from the airport quickly and easily.
