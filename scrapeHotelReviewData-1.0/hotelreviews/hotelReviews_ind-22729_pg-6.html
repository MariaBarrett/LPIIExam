ReviewText:Long wait lines at the front desk. Find out at the time of check-in that parking is $24/night for self park or $30/night for valet. Across the street is a self-park lot for 7 a night, so definitely go for that and save you a TON of money, along with possibly seeing your car from your room like we did. Make sure you check your invoice... because they'll charge you for parking, even if you didn't use it. Had to speak with the woman at the front desk to get the charges removed. -newline-  -newline- Bathrooms were sub-par. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls, no ventilation fan for humidity of shower, light switch on the OUTSIDE (which was odd), dusty and mildew tiles in the bathroom as well. -newline-  -newline- Also, 9.95 a night for internet? I've been to MANY hotels... and I did not expect to have to pay for internet at a hotel which tries to have a "luxury" ambiance, but finds ways to gouge you in any way they can. -newline-  -newline- If you're a smoker, you have to smoke outside the front lobby or in the garden... but there are no butt cans or ash trays available on the garden level, just FYI. -newline-  -newline- All in all, it wasn't a HORRIBLE experience... just a lot of oversight on details that you'd expect to be standard in a room for the price you're paying. 2*/5*

ReviewText:My wife and I went to the hotel after our wedding night.  Like most newlyweds, we were looking for peace and quiet after the whirlwind of the wedding and reception.  There was a major party going on in one of the ballrooms, but our room on the 5th floor was spotless, elegant, and comfortable.  No problems with party-goers roaming the halls, and a view of the rooftop garden greeted us the next morning with serenity.

ReviewText:The hotel was beautiful. I loved the Japanese decor and found the hotel to be very spacious. It was useful having the shop within the hotel and hotel parking. I also loved the gardens (although I was expecting a roof garden). I used the gym facilities which were fine and found the bedroom very comfortable. -newline- The negatives are its location. Although this is within downtown LA, it was far from the main tourist areas. However, if people don't mind using public transport, the train station is about 10 minute walk. The hotel was also expensive for dining in and there are not many places nearby that we found.

ReviewText:My sister and daughter both brought cars to the hotel and the Manager gave me a deal for the parking, which would of cost quite a bit.  We were really happy w/this and the location around the Civic Center, Little Tokyo, and Olveria Street, and Union Station were all centralized for convenience.  I was sorry not to have more time at the Kyoto to enjoy the gym and lounge area.

ReviewText:My husband and I did not like this place. The bathroom looked dirty because it has not been remodeled in a long time. The bathtub was just gross. It is not in the best place. We walked down the street to eat and there was not so good people around. I heard cops cars all night.

ReviewText:The staff of this Hotel were very helpful in every way. Room was good size we had one facing the garden but the bathroom could have been bit bigger. I did find the bed very hard and ended up with a back pain and the fridge had to be turned off at night as it made too much noise.
