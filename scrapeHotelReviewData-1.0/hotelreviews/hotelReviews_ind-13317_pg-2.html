ReviewText:We were in town for the Rose Bowl and this location was perfect. Easy access to Pasadena, Hollywood and Beverly Hills. The staff, especially the valet, we're very friendly and accommodating.

ReviewText:Have family in Northridge and wedding functions in Hollywood and Santa Monic. Location was perfect. The bar was an unexpected surprise. Checked in late so went there for a meal. We found several hotel guests and locals. Together with two great barmen we had pleasant and interesting conversations with all. Enjoyed it so much that we took dinner there every free night and while the barmen, guests and locals changed, it was delightful.

ReviewText:The hotel looks great . The location is OK. -newline- The service not great. The bell hop took my luggage and brought it into the hotel and then left it with me to carry to my room. -newline- The bathroom had black looking mold in the shower! -newline- The shampoo and conditioner dispensers in the shower didn't work. -newline- The towels we skimpy at best. -newline- The rug had a stain on it not very attractive. -newline- We ordered room service and had to ask for a table to be delivered to eat our food the tray was left on the desk so we set up our own food. -newline- We told the front desk when we were checking out about the problems and they said they would have it taken care of but I nocticed they were not writing anything down. -newline- The bed was comfortable so we did get a good night sleep.

ReviewText:The Amarano Hotel is flawless. It was the perfect choice for celebrating Christmas with family. Closeby to relatives in The Hollywood Hills, we also enjoyed easy driving experiences to Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks and The Americana Mall in Glendale (great shopping!). The lobby is beautiful, festive yet serene with a burning fireplace and a relaxing library sitting area. The staff is very welcoming and attentive and the rooms are immaculate. We like the free WiFi and big screen T.V. (frige is fully stocked) and the plush robes. The hotel's lobby bar is an amazing setting for a night cap before retiring to The Amarano's luxurious accommodations.

ReviewText:We stayed at the Hotel Amarano Burbank and it was wonderful. Everyone was so friendly and really made you feel welcomed. The parking was not included so be prepared for that because parking is very limited on the street. The parking attendents were so pleasent and accomidating. The front desk was outstanding. Bartenders were super friendly and very good drinks and food. It is on a main street on two sides but with the TV or radio I slept just fine. Convenient to Metro and they have drivers within 3 miles of hotel so I would highly recommend this hotel. Breakfast BeaBea's next door was to die for and a supermarket across the street also. I would go back in a heart beat.
