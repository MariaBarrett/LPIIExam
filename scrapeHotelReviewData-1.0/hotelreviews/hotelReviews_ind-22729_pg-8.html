ReviewText:Watch out for noisy conference attendees that have loud discussions into the early morning hours.  Comfortable, but outdated, rooms could use more sound-proofing.  Bathrooms could use updating as well, but overall it was average.  Very comfortable beds.

ReviewText:This was a nice hotel.  Very clean and quiet. We got a great deal on the room through [...] - for the price ($103 - 135) it was great.

ReviewText:Yanette, the receptionist who helped us on our check-in, was extremely helpful.  Due to our flight, we arrived at the hotel with our bags much earlier than the check-in time.  Our bags were stored for us and they called us in less than 2 hours that a room had been opened up for us.  After traveling, that was MUCH appreciated. -newline- Plus the food and service in Azalea restaurant was great!

ReviewText:The room was clean and nice, but I had to wait 15 minutes to check in (with no one in front of me) while the one woman at the desk answered the phone. I had a meeting with a make-up artist with bags in my room, and it took 30 minutes for a bell captain to arrive. When I was heading out to my event one night, I went down to the self-serve parking only to find that the valets had parked about 5 cars in front of mine. I nearly missed the movie premiere I was in town for because of this, and no one even apologized.

ReviewText:Japanese hotel is better than most of local hotels, as they often more thoughtful. Equiptment in hotel is newer. I cannot find any thing wrong, only the noisy of Downtown, I guess all downtown hotel have the same problem.

ReviewText:This hotel is total RIP-OFF! -newline-  -newline- 1. hotel parking is $24 any time when you IN & OUT. -newline- there is parking lot right next to hotel but they don't have over night so You'll have to stick with HOTEL owned parking lots. (basically no choice but parking on hotel's) -newline-  -newline- 2. Hotel charges $10 daily for Internet. now a days, every other hotel provides this for FREE I don't understand why this hotel is charging $10 for super slow internet service. -newline-  -newline- 3. TV is analog old outdated, None flat small screen. Not many channels. Even $100 Holiday Inn has 38" LCD screen better screen. Definitely thumbs down! -newline-  -newline- 3. Expensive breakfast & Room service charge. -newline- I've ordered $25 breakfast and management billed me room service + delivery fee + TAX = $51 on top of breakfast. (And this is not including TIP!) -newline-  -newline- I've never ate this much expensive breakfast ever before. Even this breakfast is expensiver than DUBAI. Total RIP-OFF!*  What the hack is delivery fee anyway?? Isn't it supposely included in room service? anyway room service charge is way too high! -newline-  -newline- If you are looking for clean & nice/quite hotel, easy in&out. Please look for Mariott courtyard in Citadel or Holiday Inn express, They are MUCH MUCH better. This hotel is average but charge more than Ritz Carton Hotel. -newline- I will definitely not visit this hotel ever again.
