ReviewText:I'm pretty exacting when it comes to hotel cleanliness. I found this hotel to be IMMACULATE. The bed was very comfortable and exceptionally clean - no icky bedspread to deal with; instead, there's a white cover that I am assuming is changed for each guest. -newline-  -newline- The hotel isn't fancy, but they provide all you need. We rarely stay in our room as we generally travel to see the sights, so we don't see the need for spas, turn downs, exotic restaurants at our hotel. We need a clean bed and bath - just what we got. Don't be afraid to stay here!

ReviewText:EVERYTHING OK WITH THE MOTEL, CLEAN, QUIET, PARKING, PRICE. LOCATION IS THE TOUGH PART, TO GET JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FREEWAY SYSTEM, ALMOST NO WAY AROUND IT. LEARN THE BACK AND SIDE ROADS TO GET INTO HOLLYWOOD AND ANY DESTINATION SOUTH OR WEST. GOOD VALUE, CLEAN AND QUIET.

ReviewText:We stayed here after spending the day at Universal, and I must say, I'm impressed. After reading reviews for other hotels around Universal City, I was concerned. It seemed that everywhere was either too expensive, or had horrible reviews, so we were lucky to find this place; it was great. When we walked in, my first impression was how clean it was. Definitely a great value for the price.

ReviewText:We were quite pleasantly surprised to find the motel to be quite attractive, very clean, (we are VERY particular!)and the staff personable, professional and knowledgeable. The location and proximity to attractions such as The Getty Museum and Universal made for an enjoyable experience. The pool was clean and we took advantage of "down" time there, too. We will refer others!

ReviewText:Hotel room was very clean and met all expectations. The hotel is very crowded and parking is VERY limited, we had to park in the street and walk to the room. Denny's is right there and you get a discount for staying at the hotel. Even after asking the lady to leave sheets and not clean the room when we were gone, someone entered the room when we weren't there because pillows were missing. Very close the the freeway.

ReviewText:I do business in the Sherman Oaks / Burbank area, flying into the Bob Hope Airport (about 20-25 min away depending on traffic.) I've found the Best Western Plus Carriage Inn to be just what I need - better than average bed, close to the 405 / Sherman Oaks / Burbank. It's in an average area - not super great but not super bad, but the parking lot is lit up like a Christmas tree so I always feel safe arriving late at night. No free breakfast but I don't eat one anyway (there is a Denny's attached.) I always stay at this hotel when I visit LA.
