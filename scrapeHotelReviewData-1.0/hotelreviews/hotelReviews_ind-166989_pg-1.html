ReviewText:Received an unexpected upgrade which always makes an experience wonderful. A beautiful room facing the pool - doesn't get any better than that. Very clean, beautiful bedroom with a very comfy bed - my daughter said she felt like princess. The staff was wonderful - very nice and friendly. Would love to stay again.

ReviewText:This is a nice little gem of a hotel. Its main selling point is the location: right on Wilshire in one of the nicest sections of LA (just outside of Beverly Hills itself, next to the LA Country Club). It has parking (for a fee) but I took the bus everywhere (the 7-day TAP card is highly recommended). It is a block from a Metro Rapid bus stop so getting places was relatively easy. The only downside to the location is that it is surrounded by luxury apartment towers and there isn't even a convenience store within a mile so you need to bring provisions back to your room (they have a tiny gift shop "alcove") or pay for room service or take the rapid bus one stop to Westwood Village. By the way, all rooms have a kitchenette with rudimentary pots and plates. The restaurant is small, pricey, limited menu, but the food is good. The pool is a real selling point. Big, heated, yet hardly used. Note to families: there is no lifeguard and there is nothing else offered in the hotel for children. My room was not very modern but it was clean. Please know that some rooms (mine for example) require climbing a few stairs. If this is a problem (wasn't for me) there are rooms that do not involve stairs. There is a fancy spa in the hotel but I never used its services (massages, facials, etc.) If you want an attractive little hotel in one of the safest and most centrally-located areas of LA for a reasonable price, then this is your hotel. If you want a big, glitzy hotel with shops inside and/or nearby and multiple restaurants/cafes as well, book yourself into the Beverly Hilton, but be prepared to pay a lot more.

ReviewText:I like the hotel & my room a lot. When I arrived I pulled in front & asked the valet where I should park. He was a very nice guy and told me that I could use the garage, but for a fee. Turns out the free is the same whether you valet or not, $28 a night! It added $56 to my hotel stay. I enjoyed the hotel & staff a lot, but would have liked some warning about the parking.

ReviewText:I was taking 2 teenagers to see LA for the first time, so we needed to be centrally located, and in a safe, nice location. This place fit the bill perfectly . We got a really good deal, and an upgraded room so we got a suite with a king size bed, and a love seat big enough to slurp on in the living room. The girls got the bed and I slept on the couch, which was fine. The hotel itself is quite magnificent. There were LOTS of stairs though, to get to our room. Hot tub was close by, but the pool was a hike, but at least it was heated! Downside is that you have to pay $28 per day to park and $10 per day extra for Internet .

ReviewText:Love love love this gem of a hotel. We were upgraded to a suite for our 4 day stay. At first we were disappointed that we had no view and needed to walk up some stairs to get to our updated suite but it proved to be perfect. There was a great hottub one level down which we enjoyed using. I got to set by the beautiful pool for only a half hour one day and that was gorgeous. It was quiet and off the beaten path with a back gate to exit to the street where we parked our car for free. Room service menu is very cheap. The Gym is fabulous. The suite was beautifully appointed with monogrammed bathrobes and slippers, fabulous linens, sheets changed every day. It was meticulously clean, freshly painted and beautifully decorated in Hollywood style. The staff was friendly, professional and efficient. -newline- I can't wait to stay there again, Rodeo drive is a 15-20 minute walk away.

ReviewText:This is what I describe as a "Look no further Hotel" Beautiful, comfortable, friendly (If I were to find any negative I would like to see reception staff smile a little more ) Charming restaurant, delightful pool area and stylish furnishings. We upgraded to a luxury suite and it was worth every penny to be located around the pool area. Beautiful fully fitted kitchen (tea-towel would have been useful ) Would recommend the homes of the stars bus tour,great fun and good value and a visit to the westwood memorial gardens on Glendon (20minute walk left outside hotel)a must! One of the most tranquil places I have ever visited. Will definately be returning to the Plaza!
