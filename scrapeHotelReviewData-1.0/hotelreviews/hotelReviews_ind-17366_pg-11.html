ReviewText:While the public areas may look a little tired the room was nice and comfortable. The bed was unusual with Sleep by number controls :-)       Location is good very near a good shopping mall... 15' walk.

ReviewText:We didn't like the fact that the buffet was the only breakfast option. If you are in a hurry or if you don't want a big breakfast, the $30 buffet is not good. The hotel could really benefit from having a few eateries on site--like having a regular-sized Starbuck instead of a Starbucks cart.   The beds were very comfortable--we loved them.   The staff varied from a couple of very nice and very helpful guys to a check-out guy who couldn't say two words to us.    Overall it was good value for the money and it's location near to the airport suited our very limited time schedule.

ReviewText:The bed was very comfortable. The sleep number bed was great, and the pillows were very comfortable also. We were there to visit my sister and the location was very close to her house. The parking fee was a bit steep, but overall it was a good experience.

ReviewText:The radisson hotel is an azing hotel to stay in, if youre looking to be close to exciting venues and other tourist places. the room was very comfortable, especially their king beds. I strongly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a nice get away.

ReviewText:The bad news is that this hotel's  nearly swastica-shapped piscine lacks lane-lines, a major pitfall for seirious lap-swimmers or the inevitable paddlers immersed in in all such chlorinecentric refuges from global warming.    The good news is that as a lapswimmer, I rarely needed to dodge a paddler while in that pool.      The bad news is that the pool is located a very long cab ride from anything worth doing or seeing in LA.  The good news is that it is located only a stones throw from LAX.

ReviewText:The hotel is very nice, comfortable and clean. For the price it is worth for not being in the best location and next to a noise, busy freeway. I would stay again.

ReviewText:I enjoyed our stay at the hotel.  However, I wasn't too thrilled with the bar closing at midnight and the restaurant closing at 11pm.  There really wasn't any restaurants in the area open past 11 pm which was very inconvenient.  However, the hotel itself was very nice and affordable.

ReviewText:this hotel was really good with customer service. the location is ok and parking is a bit pricey for where its at. the best part was the sleep number bed, it's so comfortable. although the room was pretty small, i would recommend this hotel to others.

ReviewText:This was my first stay at this property and I was very pleased with the hotel. The rooms were nice and the bed was an air mattress which was very comfortable. The location was great for where I needed to be. I would stay here again.
