ReviewText:Shuttle service from the airport to the hotel needs improvement. I was told its a 10-15 minute wait but it was more like a 45 minute wait. The shuttle doesn't stop at every shuttle pick up it passed by a couple time until I had to get to the middle of the street to waive it down. My reservation wasn't in their system until they called it in which added another 30 min wait.

ReviewText:This hotel is overrated as it is old and run down. Definitely not a 3 stars-more like 1 star. -newline- 1) we switch 3 rooms in order to have a room with proper hot water to shower. The rooms are either too small can't even fit a roll out bed or no hot water at all or patio door do not open or bathroom door do not lock. -newline- 2) all 3 rooms have walls peeling or moldy edges bathroom. Our last room is the only one with proper bathtub (rest are shower or fall off tiles). Be prepare when the shower runs it comes out so little water, takes mins to get hot water so once you get water.. Be fast- don't expect to enjoy it as these are very old shower heads. -newline- 3) room card 4 out of 6 nights do not work, we have to walk far far down to lobby to get it re-program again and again. -newline- 4) do not drive,as it is $8/ night parking plus room card only selectively wants to open the gates. So you can get in and cannot get out or can't get in at all. -newline- 5) room service are best, they come knock your door at 530am.. Oops wrong room after. They wake everyone up. -newline- 6) front desk service staffs... Extremely in bad mood at all time. They promise to give a $10 discount to our room-well did not happen, supervisor only say it but no notes.. So the staff says to us, "you have so much problems, why don't you wait till our manager comes to work." So customers if you have issue, they want you to miss your flights or appointment and wait for their manager. She actually recommend us not to check out first and wait for manager to go to work in order to get the $10 discount they promise the night before, but they don't think of making any calls. So they can make the extra $10..we are too fed up with all the bs past few days to stay any longer. -newline- 7) mattresses double are extremely small.. Not good for 2 thin people also very squeaky. So do not move or your partner will be riding roller coaster all night or only sleep 1. Do not recommend for family. -newline- 8) this hotel is too cheap, still using old style TV full of streaks when it plays. -newline-  -newline- Will not come back ever ever again.

ReviewText:The room was clean. Thats as good as it gets. No fridge, microwave, or ac unit, tv doesnt have many channels. They put an extra 50 dollar hold on your card when you arrive if its a debit card. The housekeeping lady walked in on me while I was naked despite not requesting room service. Awesome place.

ReviewText:Stayed here for 2 nights. When I first got there, there was a long pube on the sink and there was a lot of "water" stains on the bathroom counter. It had clearly not been cleaned by the staff prior to me checking in. When I returned to my room on my second night, the room was exactly how I had left it - bed not made, trash not emptied, no clean towels.

ReviewText:Everything was fine.Room was clean.Location was very convenient with supermarkets,restaurants.banks..etc right across to the street.The most convenient stuff is that there is a car rental office located in the hotel that makes my rental even more convenient.

ReviewText:Bell Hop very helpful; Check-in scary/stupid - provided ID and he still made charge on my CC for another guest. Room OK - small but very clean, nice linens/bedclothes. Towels ok; sink fixture not secured to the sink; shower head old and didn't work well. A mini fridge & 2nd door lock would be a great addition. Parking is Extra$$, outdoor only, & not very convenient. Security on South Tower back door is lax; doors do not close every time & area should be better lit at night.
