ReviewText:Overall we had a great stay, just didn't like how we kept getting interrupted or walked in on by cleaning people who kept trying to bring things we already had

ReviewText:It's your basic 60's style travel motel. Not fancy but good clean accommodations. Good deal for the price and location is great, 2 minutes from the 405 and 101 interchange. No problem recommending it.

ReviewText:I was worried at first because I saw some homeless people residing around this hotel. However, I was able to walk every day to the metro line for about six blocks with no incidents. Quick access to orange line (from Sepulveda to North Hollywood Station) that connects you to red line (from North Hollywood to Union Station). These lines cross along the highlights of Los Angeles. You can get to Grauman´s Theater the walk o fame, downtown Los Angeles, Universal City and mucho more. -newline- Carpet was clean, bed done every day, nice tv, coffe, small work station with lamp on it, iron table and safe deposit box. -newline- Soda, icecream, water and chips vending machines on premises. Clean pool as far as I could see. -newline- Presenting your key card at denny´s you get 10% dicount, while your a guest at Carriage Inn Plus Los Angeles. -newline- Few other restaurants within walking distance like chicken rottiserie, chinnese food and burguers. -newline- I was there form the 25th to 29th sept. -newline- Transport from hotel to Los Angeles Airport LAX is cheaper if you take the metro lines to Union Station (U$3) and once you are there catch the FlyAway bus (U$7) in bay #9, because most shuttle companies charge U$40 for same transportation.

ReviewText:My complaints about the Carriage Inn are very minor. I was trying to book a place and having internet issues but finally got this one. A previous experience with a different chain had me expecting bad or at least mediocre, but Carriage Inn really surprised me. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the rooms were overall clean, in great shape, and comfortable. I did find a couple toenail clippings in a corner that were missed, and the TV was staticky on a few channels, but those are very minor complaints. The staff was super-courteous and friendly, and even the cleaning staff (I interrupted a maid three times with items I'd forgotten in my room, and she was very gracious about my interruptions). Everything was in great shape, I will gladly return and recommend to anyone in need of a hotel in the Sherman Oaks area.

ReviewText:Room was clean and spacious. I arrived at 2 AM and the staff was very pleasant and helpful. As promised internet access available in the room and parking was free! A definite bonus. I paid a bit more than I normally would, but convience and proximity were worth the extra price.Would stay there again on my next trip.

ReviewText:This Hotel has a lovely pool with clean rooms. When you're traveling you can't ask for much more than that. the staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, my experience with the hotel was great. They only offer coffee in the morning though and parking was a bit ridiculous if you happened to come in after midnight. There wasn't a spot for us, which meant we had to make our own!
