ReviewText:Terrific attention to guests; very nice room; fireplace was unexpected delight; so were the incredibly reasonable mini bar prices. Pool excellent, on roof.

ReviewText:The only thing impressive about this hotel is the size of the suites. The bathrooms were small, dark and in desperate need of a face lift! -newline- I got the impression that the sheets on our bed had not been changed when we checked in, but did not complain about it. -newline- The location is good (very close to Sunset blvd and Beverly Hills) -newline- The valet service is expensive (30$, but that's what you expect in L.A.) but the guys themselves were very helpful and accommodating.

ReviewText:This is the third time we have stayed at Le Montrose. It is a great value for the money. The rooms are large, the bed is comfortable, there is a large screen TV on the wall in the bedroom area and another TV in the living area. Service is excellent. Employees are very friendly. We will definitely stay there again on our next visit to LA and our daughter and her family. The location is terrific, just down from Sunset Blvd and a couple of blocks from Santa Monica Blvd. Food at the hotel was good.

ReviewText:The first surprise is the $28 dollar a night parking charge. That is almost $300 for the amount of nights we were staying there!  I was abit upset about that. My nephew came to visit for 2 hours and was towed outside the hotel.  To park at the hotel would have cost him $28.00.  No visitor parking for free -newline-  -newline- The first room was ok except when you attempted to pull the shower plunger to start the shower the whole unit came out of the wall! The floor in the bathroom looked dirty and the view was another building being costructed. -newline-  -newline- I complained to several staff members, then management and they had me pay about $200 for parking. They changed our room to a better suite that was nicer but the tub unit still came out of the wall some. (Not as bad as the first one though). -newline-  -newline- Had 2 large screen tv's with gameboy for my son.  Staff mostly was friendly.  Hotel is in a funky area of residential homes.  Is difficult to find at first. Had a cute little fire place.  Gave us a suite without any cooking utensils to use in the kitchen for the second room. -newline-  -newline- Over all it was an ok experience.  Not what I thought of for a 4 star hotel.

ReviewText:It truly was a pleasant surprise to discover and explore Le Montrose. The art nouveau decor was complimentary to the cozy and secluded feeling of the property.  The staff was invisible, yet accommodated my every request, and its laid back demeanor belied the fact that it was minutes away from LA's hottest destinations.

ReviewText:The staff was great from the valet, to the front desk, to housekeeping.  The location is within walking distance of everywhere in WeHo you would want to be.  The rooms are spacious.

ReviewText:The hotel screwed up my reservation, then the front desk guy was rude when I tried to get it fixed. Orbitz did a GREAT job getting things in order. The hotel is in a very convenient location, but the 4 Star rating that was posted was definitely too high. The "multi-million dollar renovations" weren't enough and the $$$ was poorly spent. The carpet was unravelling. The bathroom counters and tile didn't match, cheap bath/showers, etc. All-in-all. . .3 stars and overpriced.
