ReviewText:I needed to stay near LAX. This is close without being on Century Blvd. Got two good night's sleep in a quite room. Free internet. Dated room style with stall shower and small countertop. Perfect. Overnight parking is secure and only $5

ReviewText:The waiting room and surronding area is very nice and tastefully decorated. Reception is terrible, the people are friendly but I do not understand why it takes 10 minutes (literally) to check in each person. The line to check in was going out the door. The hallways and hotel rooms do not match the nice decor of the reception area. Some of the buttons to floors on the elevator didn't work and one of the two elevators didn't work at all. The woman next to us was unable to get into her room for over an hour because her key didn't work and the hotel could not figure out what to do

ReviewText:Great value for price.  Needed a place near the airport and didn't want to pay for frills when all we were doing is sleeping their.  Rooms were clean and quiet.  24 hour LAX shuttle is great.

ReviewText:We only stayed there one night, just to get to LAX in the morning, and for that purpose it was good enough. i wouldnt want to stay there for a longer then that. The interior of the hotel is dated and gives off a strange vibe.  My husband hated it, but for the price, and the fact that we were only there to sleep, it was fine.  The redeeming aspects of the hotel is the nice outside courtyard, and that alot of rooms have balconies overlooking the courtyard. The restaraunt attached was perfect for a good breakfast before the airport.

ReviewText:Nice hotel, good service, good restaurant called Mariposa.  Good fast service, great soups.  Reasonably priced meals and nice waiters. We will be returning to the hotel on our last day of our trip.  The hotel has free shuttle service to LAX which is a real bonus for us.  Nice and convenient.
