ReviewText:Everyone at the hotel was so very nice. All of the staff that we had interaction with were pleasant and made us feel welcome. Also, the bartender makes a great pina coloda!..Our flight was cancelled due to Hurricane Irene and the hotel staff were very accomodating even providing the room at a discount rate due to the circumstances. Will definitely stay there again.

ReviewText:The hotel waqs really nice. We checked in a little early , so the room dfidn't have a refrig as we had requested earlier. They brought one that didn't work. But we called them up and they brought one right away to replace it and it met our needs fine. There was also no clock radio in our room , but they brought one right away. The location was good for our needs, although road construction was ongoing.

ReviewText:Visit with my first grandchild in CA.  When we stayed at Sheraton Four Points we had free breakfast buffet and parking. When you stay for 14 nights this adds up.  July 4th I was unable to get into my room for over an hour due to the door misfunctioning. It was fixed the next day.  However,I was tired after watching the fireworks with family and got got in traffic and it was after   midnight before the staff admitted there was something wrong with the door.

ReviewText:Very nice looking hotel! Greeted at the front desk with a smile and warm cookies! The bed was comfortable and the towels were soft. My only complaint is that the trash from the previous guest had not been cleaned up, there was even old shopping bags and empty containers sitting under the night stand(weird)... Besides that, all was well.
