ReviewText:I have nothing but positive comments about this hotel.  The only negative was that it didn't come with a refrigerator or microwave which could have come in handy.  Otherwise, it was a perfectly pleasant stay.

ReviewText:We have stayed at the Hilton Checkers many times and have never been disappointed.  We enjoy staying at smaller, boutique hotels.  The Hilton is updated, comfortable, clean, and quiet, and the staff is friendly and eager to please.

ReviewText:The staff at this hotel were all professional and caring, I couldn't fault the service. The food was a very high standard, although a bit pricey, but no more than comparable hotels. The roof terrace was lovely; the pool was small but clean and heated to 90 degrees which was great and, as it wasn't busy, the size of the pool was fine. The hotel had a lot of character and style and my son and I really enjoyed staying there.

ReviewText:We had a great experience at the Hilton Checkers. The room was spotless, the bed was very comfy, and the room was a good size for a downtown hotel. The food at the bar and at the restaurant was superb and the staff was super friendly and helpful. Our only complaint is that the parking fee was quite expensive.

ReviewText:I used to live in LA but this time returned as a cultural tourist. As a New Yorker there for a long weekend I didn't want to be burdened with a car so I wanted a place within walking distance to Disney Hall and to the main subway hub. On top of that, the service staff was polite and deferential. The rooms minimalist/Zen decorated which was very relaxing. The bar served the restaurant food and it was delicious and quickly served. My first morning the hot water knob in the shower was broken. Within 10 minutes of calling Guest Services the engineer was in the room and had fixed the problem. Very clean room. Though I faced the street I heard no noise through the windows. The HVAC air system was super quiet; I could barely hear when it kicked in. I didn't hear guests surrounding my room or in the hallway.

ReviewText:The downtown checkers was close to my meeting place but not very comfy. I wanted a king size bed for me and hubby and ended up with 2 doubles, also the parking was 52 dollars for two days and for the price of the room, parking should have been included. the hotel is very old and dingy. I will not be stying there agiain.
