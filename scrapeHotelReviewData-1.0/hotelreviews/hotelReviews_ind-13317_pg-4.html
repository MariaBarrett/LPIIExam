ReviewText:The hotel was very nice and clean and the bed was comfortable. I loved the shower--walk-in. The staff were cordial, friendly, and helpful. However, I thought it was strange that patrons have to pay extra to use the cabana in the pool area when everything at poolside should be for the use of the patrons at no extra cost. I think management needs to rethink their policy. My husband and I didn't want to swim but during the evening or early morning thought it would be nice to sit out by the pool under the cabana and write, since we are authors, and maybe read, but we weren't about to pay extra for the privilege that should have already be included to the guests. -newline- A bit pricey for what you get.

ReviewText:Words can not express this wonderful Hotel and its staff, from the check in desk to the valet service. Let's just say that my wife and I are planning on return to Burbank Ca in July/August 2013. it was so great that we wanted to extended our stay for 3 more days. Innformation I will request from Orbiz just in case we need it when we return, this time we will stay for at least 7 -10 days. Thank you , thank you for everything you have done to make this a great trip. the airport is 10 minutes away.

ReviewText:The Amarano Hotel was comfortable and staff friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious, bed luxuriously comfortable. We loved the pool area, private and not too crowded. -newline- We were able to walk to local restaurants. Wanted to get to Bob's Big Boy Car Hop type restaurant for the Friday night car show, to which we could have walked-ran out of time. -newline- The hotel staff was willing to drive us anywhere locally, and did so a few times. Universal Studios was nearby-generally found Amarano to be centrally located.
