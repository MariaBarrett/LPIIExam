ReviewText:The room is too warm and depressed, there is no air circulation. The room is small and the sound insulation is not good.

ReviewText:We needed to be up at 0530 to catch a plane. We had a portable alarm clock but to make sure that we did not miss our flight, we called the front desk and asked for a wake up call at 0530. The alarm clock worked but the wake up call never came. When I mentioned this lapse to the front desk on leaving the hotel, the desk clerk seemed totally bored with my complaint (as if this happened all the time).

ReviewText:In our room the deadbolt did not work and the screen on the porch on the deck was not in place. Had fallen off and it was on the side. So we couldn't crack the window--and it was hot in the room. We did use a chain for the door. -newline- The front desk staff were very nice and the shuttle to the airport was on time.

ReviewText:Great location for LAX, dingy interior to hotel but room was clean and comfortable. Good value if you don't care about dirty hallway rugs

ReviewText:Two exchanges of card keys that didn't work lead to an eventual room change. If you or your traveling companions have mobility issues and cannot negotiate stairs, be aware. When you exit the elevator, there are a few steps down to the main hallway. Upon entering the room, it was stuffy and the only way to cool things down was to open a large sliding glass door. There is no climate control in the rooms. The lights were on some sort of sensor, so if I stood on the side of the room opposite the door for longer than five minutes or so, the lights would shut off and I would have to cross the room to turn them back on. There were a pair of pink sandals at the head of the bed when I arrived. They were not mine. The bed was very stiff and noisy, though the linens were clean and adequate. The television was having color issues and the furnishings looked to be dorm-room cast-offs. The bathtub drain had to be held open in order to empty the tub, however, there were clean and plentiful towels as well as toiletries and a functioning hair dryer. The ONLY saving grace of my one-night stay was the desk staff (I believe his name was Jason). He was pleasant, efficient and apologetic. Had I not had a 5am flight the next day I would have asked for a refund and found other lodging.
