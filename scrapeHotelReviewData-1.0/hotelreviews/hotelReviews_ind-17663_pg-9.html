ReviewText:This hotel was great. I have been staying at several places over the past two weeks in California and this hotel was the best hands down. The help was wonderful, so helpful and cheerful. -newline- The room and the pool were very clean. I wish I had spent more that one night there but next time I am in LA I will return. The location close to the freeway was very convenient.

ReviewText:very clean comfortable double queen bed room. Did not use all the services offered at this hotel as i was here on business. Stayed three nights and every night the place was filled to capacity. Parking was a bit tight when i arrived later in the evening. I would certainly stay here when in the Burbank area.

ReviewText:I felt that the Best Western Carriage House was very comfortable and cloan, it was in a good location close to all of the LA surroundings making it easy to get around, had a 24 hour Denny's right next door for any late night snacks or early morning breakfast, the staff was very helpful and nice, would stay again with no hesitation.

ReviewText:This hotel is very close to 405 & 110. About 10 minutes away from Universal, 15 to 30 depends on traffic to Santa Monica Pier, 30 min to Griffin Observatory and Walk of Fame area, straight drive on the 405 to LAX took 45 min because of morning traffic. The only complaint I have is because the hotel doors are directly outside I can smell people smoking other than that decent location drivable to local stores would stay here again when visiting LA area

ReviewText:The staff was kind and the room was nice - very clean, comfy bed, good sized bathroom, and the housekeepers took great care of us! We had an interesting schedule, but they paid close attention and were still able to clean our room when we left. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially because the weather in this location is always warmer than the rest of Los Angeles. -newline-  -newline- Its' location is central to all of LA, so it was easy to get around. Having Denny's on site was great because it's open 24 hours, so we never had to worry about leaving the hotel for food. When we did want to get out for a meal, their are a TON of options very close by, everything from fast food to fine dining. -newline-  -newline- I would definitely stay here again - especially for the great deal and value we got at this hotel!

ReviewText:When my cousin and I decided to take a roadtrip to California for the weekend, we had a pretty hard time finding where to stay. We wanted something that was within our budget but that didnt look like something out of a horror flick! We also needed it to have a perfect location for all the places we wanted to go. Thank God we found the Best Western Carriage Inn! This hotel has the PERFECT location!! Everywhere we wanted to go was 30 min away tops! Close to places like Hollywood bLvd, Santa Monica/Venice Beach, Universal City and Six Flags Magic Mountain! The rooms were VERY clean and comfortable! It had all the amenities we could ask for like a fridge, tv with HBO, coffee maker, iron, safe, extra pillow and blanket already there and best of all FREE WIFI! The staff at the front desk were very nice, helpful and attentive! Everything was pretty much perfect EXCEPT THE PARKING! They have such limited spaces here that any time we would get back to the hotel late, it would be completely full! It was pretty frustrating after getting back so tired and wanting to go to bed! We had to wait about 10 mins for someone to leave and another time we needed help from the staff to park! That's the only reason i didnt give it an overall of 5 stars! I recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to the LA/Hollywood area and I will definitely be staying here again!!! Thank you Best Western!!
