ReviewText:If you value your car, do not stay here. There is no option to self park, valet parking only, (at exorbitant rates, btw). I've had trouble with valets damaging my vehicles in the past so I made sure to have the valet inspect the vehicle for damage before the car was parked and verify that it was in pristine condition. When I picked up my vehicle the next day, there was exterior damage to the door. I reported it immediately, filled out the appropriate forms before I left, and had the damage documented photographically. A week later I still had no response so I called the numbers on the forms. No one returned my calls. Finally, I received an email stating that -newline- their investigation into this matter yielded no evidence that they were negligent and thus, would deny my claim for damages. The car was in perfect condition when left with them, damaged when returned to me, but they deny responsibility. I imagine that this is probably a standard response in the industry. I don't intend to give up that easily though. I would speculate that their response would be the same if you had something stolen from your room or if you were injured at the hotel as a result of their negligence. This is an old, well known hotel, that I once respected. Well, they no longer have my respect and my advice to you is, AVOID THIS HOTEL. But, if you must stay here, DO NOT PARK YOUR CAR WITH THE VALET.

ReviewText:The rooms were not as updated and modern as I would've liked but it is an older historic hotel so I guess that would be expected. The rest of the hotel was breathtaking! Looks just like the pictures online. The staff was very helpful and nice. The location was also convenient to all the places that I wanted to visit. The downside was that it was valet parking only at $40 per night!

ReviewText:Best price in the area. Beautiful Hotel, they don't/can't building them like that any more. The staff was as helpful and courteous as any hotel I have every stayed at. The restaurant was excellent as were the surrounding restaurants, and there were a number to choose from.

ReviewText:This hotel is a dive. The carpets are held together with duct tape, the hallways smell like old cigarettes, and the rooms smell of mold and are drafty. The noise from the street is like living next to a 24 hour construction site. The photos on the website definetely do not match the rooms offeres unless you upgrade from pressure from the front desk at check-in. Don't check in wearing casual clothing or the front desk personnel will treat you as a transcient! I would not recommend this to my worse enemy!!!!!

ReviewText:The lobby bar and grand hall are amazing. The rooms are fine. The location is excellent. I can't say that it was the best value, but besides that, it was great.
