ReviewText:The location was convenient. The management helpful. The room did not have room dark shades so that the light came into our room at night and morning. They said they will be getting better curtains. They have updated the place. They definitely made an improvement.

ReviewText:I liked the intimacy of this hotel, staff was great, place was clean and relatively quiet. I stayed for two nights and felt very safe. Only thing I did not like was the parking fee, which I felt was too high.

ReviewText:This hotel wasn't bad for the price. The location was not ideal, it was in between BH and Westwood. Walking to either took a good 20 minutes so it is best to have a car (which costs 30/day to park). Rooms were fine. The walls were a little thin so I could hear people in other rooms. The amenities were great, no complaints there. The staff was also great and very helpful. Bottom line: good hotel if you are looking to avoid paying Bevery Hills rates but still want a decent hotel in a decent location.

ReviewText:The hotel has been updated with a beautiful lobby, health club and spa faciltiiteis. It is convenient to shopping, attractions, major roads and highways. The staff is freindly and accommodating. -newline- We love the idea of having the ability to make a quick breakfast, lunch or snack in the room.

ReviewText:High expectations based on marketing and past reviews.  Got disappointing room in Anex - Tight, making NYC hotels feel roomy, no real ability to have natural light in bedroom with privacy, could hear the people upstairs pacing. -newline-  -newline- Fine gym equipment although lack of attention to detail - no water cups on both mornings. -newline-  -newline- No place to order a drink with a guest at 9:15pm - Was told to get a beer from room fridge and consume by the pool; Breakfast area so poorly appointed and small, I had to move breakfast meeting to another venue at the last minute.
