ReviewText:GOOD SERVICE WITH A STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP THAT ONLY OPENS AT 6AM AND CLOSES AT 3PM????? -newline-  -newline- OVERALL THE HOTEL WAS GREAT... -newline-  -newline- JUST THAT THE LOCATION ADDRESS SAYS"AVENUE OF THE STARS' WHICH I FEEL IS MISLEADING COS YOU HAVE TO GET TO HOLLYWOOD WHICH IS AROUND 20 TO 30 MINS FROM THE HOTEL BY CAB. THATS WHERE ALL THE BUZZ IS.

ReviewText:The hotel was considered a 5 star but did not have those accomodations.  Parking was extremely expensive and should have been disclosed; the marble on our floor in the elevator foyer was chipped very badly and could have caused a fall with heels on. There are no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms.  The carpet on the terrace was badly burned with cigarette holes. The carpet had stains and the linens were soiled and cheap.  Pillows were stained.  I would definitely do an overhaul!

ReviewText:This is one of the best places to stay with my family in L.A.  Nice pool, child safe areas and friendly staff. The location is perfect, Century City is just around the corner; even Beverly Hills is walking distance. You can take the 405 fwy very easy.

ReviewText:The hotel was great.  Clean, nice sized rooms. Loved the balcony overlooking the pool area - every room has a balcony too.  The location was fabulous, about a mile walking distance to Beverly Hills shopping centers.  Great mall across the street with wonderful restaurants.  Staff was friendly and helpful, but service to the room was slow - it took over an hour for us to get a rollaway bed the first night.  (Due to a convention the hotel was hosting they were out of double beds and we got a king instead of our requested doubles.  We got our doubles the second night there).  If you want a coffeemaker in your room you have to ask for one, but it is free of charge.  Not the hotel's fault, but there were several guests having a party on their balcony at 3 am our first night there and they were extremely loud.  They were several floors above us, but we could still hear the noise quite clearly.  If you want to get your exercise without paying for the health club, there are a few walking routes that the hotel provided for me.  The weather was quite pleasant, and the routes were scenic, so a morning walk ended up being a very nice thing to do!  Pool service was great, and there were always nice lounge chairs and umbrellas available for us to use.

ReviewText:Easy access and shopping/food options with the mall across the street.  The rooms were nothing special and the staff, though friendly, was not necessarily helpful.

ReviewText:The room rate from [...] was fare. But they get you on the back-end with food, parking/valet, mini-bar prices. This is a business property. Prepare yourself for the $35 a day valet parking charge. If you self park, it's $20. But if you leave, it's $20 every 2 hours.
