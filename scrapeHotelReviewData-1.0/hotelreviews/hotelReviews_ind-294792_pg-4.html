ReviewText:Location very convenient, rooms clean and comfortable, if a bit sparse. (A kettle for coffee/tea in the morning would be nice.) Internet service was flawless and with very good throughput.

ReviewText:Awesome staff. Rooftop pool/bar is just an ideal place to chill and check out for a while. Will definitely return.

ReviewText:Not your chilled romantic getaway on a Saturday night. Is more of a LA party scene place. Fun if this is what you are up for.

ReviewText:The hotel experience was fine. My issues were with the website I booked the room with. their name has to do with what a planet does around the sun. I booked this room for an employee and provided a corporate Credit card to pay for the room. When my employee tried to check in he was told there was a problem with the card and he ended up having to use his personal card in order to check in. Very unprofessional folks. Don't bother with the discount. I will not be using this website in the future.

ReviewText:Great design, fun atmosphere. Free wifi appreciated. Drinking water would have been nice, either in the room or down the hall. At the roof bar, $8 beer in a small plastic cup seemed a bit much.

ReviewText:Fun atmosphere, great customer service, pleasant stay... -newline- The hotel upgraded us to a bigger room, which was awesome! A few light bulbs were out & the iPod player was broken, but the front desk was quick to send someone up. Overall, it was great!
