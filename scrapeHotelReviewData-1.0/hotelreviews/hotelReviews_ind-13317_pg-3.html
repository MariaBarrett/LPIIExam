ReviewText:Very nice hotel, Very Clean. The bed was very comfortable. Good spot. Valet parking was bit expensive, $38 total but close to the going rate in LA. Too bad they don't have a self park option. But other than that, great place. Would stay again. Tip: request high floor to avoid some of the traffic noise.

ReviewText:If you need to stay in Burbank, this is a great spot. Staff was excellent. At first it felt a bit claustrophobic, after staying in so many large chain hotels, but after a few days, I felt the charm.

ReviewText:I couldn't have spent my 4 days of work in a better place for the money. The rooms were clean and modern, the front desk staff was helpful, everything worked properly in my room, and the internet was free. Right across the street from the hotel. was a strip mall that included a Strabucks, a place to send packages, a drug store, a grocery store (where you could also get a Starbucks), a great breakfast place, a sushi place, a place to get your nails done, and a pet store. The downside, the rooms have less than average views, and only the pool view rooms have balconies were you can sit outside (more expensive) and the hotel parking is $32 at this publishing. You can park on the street around the hotel for free if you can find a spot. The neighborhood is reasonably safe. It is mostly rental apartments that seem to be kept up well. I will return.

ReviewText:The hotel was right across the street from a 24 hr grocery store which was convenient because the rooms have microwaves and fridges. The staff were pleasant and the room was very clean and comfortable. The hotel is only a short distance away from Hollywood blvd, however the neighborhood the The Amarano is located in is very quiet and peaceful.

ReviewText:Very positive experience. Since we arrived, we had a great time, nice staff, comfortable room, tasty food, very much Boutique Hotel feel to it. -newline- The only thing, depending on the purpose of your trip, it is a little far from the center of Los Angeles (30 to 45 minutes from LAX)

ReviewText:This boutique hotel is located near small restaurants and more importantly a supermarket which is very convenient. The room was a decent size and clean. The parking is ridiculously expensive for Burbank (over $30 a night) but there is street parking available. If you need to stay in Burbank this hotel is a pleasant surprise.
