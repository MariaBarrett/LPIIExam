ReviewText:In June 2010 we stayed five nights at The Standard in downtown LA and enjoyed our visit very much. The staff were always very friendly and helpful, and our room, [...], was spacious, impressively decorated, and kept very clean. Although we are seniors, we thoroughly enjoyed the young vibe on the weekend at The Standard. Also, we liked very much this hotel's central downtown location. We easily walked to places and events in the downtown area.I would stay there again and would recommend The Standard to other travelers.

ReviewText:I've been there several times with coworkers for Happy Hour on their rooftop bar which is fun and has an awesome view of Los Angeles, so I thought it would be a fabulous place to stay...NOT SO!!!! -newline-  -newline- THE ROOMS ARE INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND DISGUSTING!  It seems like the hotel was going for a contemporary look which was compromised of inexpensive nouveau furniture and the bed mattress was 6 inches off the floor on a mattress box.  You may as well sleep on the ground.  It also seemed quite disgusting that the sheets and comforter were tucked under the mattress and landed on top of the box where people can step on since the box extends beyond the width of the mattress. -newline-  -newline- The bathroom had its issues as well.  The bathroom looked like a gym locker room that hadn't been cleaned and had no room for my toiletries.  I felt like I needed to have my shoes on the entire time. The faucet water smelled like a sewer and the scent from complimentary bar soap made me nauseous. -newline-  -newline- Don't bother getting room service here either because the food was not very tasty.

ReviewText:Honestly I was shocked and appalled at the rooms at the Standard.  The hotel rooms are akin to what I would imagine staying in a Motel 6 would be like.  They have a mattress on a platform--no real comfortable bed with an army blanket on top no comforter.  The room is extremely sparse with cheap plastic chair and table.  The shower is completely see through so if you are a family or staying with friends you probably do not want someone watching or in the room while you take a shower.  Privacy anyone?  The pool area is cool but the lounge chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I would NEVER stay at the Standard again and I highly highly caution you from staying there.  The only thing the Standard is worth is the party at night.  Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else and party there.

ReviewText:Funky hotel.  Great food.  Central location. -newline-  -newline- Service, however, was skin deep...  Staff were very friendly, but not necessarily wanting to take responsibility... -newline-  -newline- The phone in my room didn't work properly: it didn't ring and messages vaporised into thin air.  No-one came to look at it, and it probably still doesn't work.  The operator just "put a note on her system" - it worked, but I wouldn't want to rely on it... -newline-  -newline- I had an issue at checkout, being charged US$6.75 each for 5 or 6 cartons of water which were not listed on the mini-bar price list and I had assumed they were complimentary.  After some argument they were taken off the bill, and a further reduction was made as a goodwill gesture. -newline-  -newline- The food really was outstanding for an American hotel.  The coffee (even the espresso), however, was as awful as anywhere in the US.

ReviewText:When we got there the Valet was nice...when we got to the front desk the hotel staff ruined the whole 2 minute experience so far by their rudeness and unprofessional actions. not one time do they look at you nor answer your question untill you ask atleast twice.... i ignored that and me n my friend both checlked in along with my other friend checking in to his room... we had 3 rooms there oh and they messed up on my room too.... right before we were going to the club, the Female security/lady that gives wrist bands was completely rude and started yelling so we were rude back and she basically refused to let the birthday person up to the rooftop along with his 3 friends. BUT, we had given them business of over 30 people already paid and waiting for us upstairs! so we talked to the manager and yet, he was completely unprofessional and rude....he would videotape us when we spoke our minds and not record himself when he is cursing or being completely unprofessional/"tough"....he did not allow us up and or nor ANYTHING! so the birthday boy spent it in his room and the 30 plus people waited for him for nothing upstairs! alll because of the UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF! I would love a refund for everything and am gunna take this a lot further!

ReviewText:since  the holtel was located closed to  where i was supposed to work during my trip, it was kinda convenient to move. -newline- other than that.  i didn't really enjoyed it. -newline- maybe  i could have stayed  much nicer hotel with the price. -newline- overall the hotel looks old  but  seemed that  they  tried to look  hip. yes  the  roof top lounge was kinda cool  but  that's the only thing  i liked. -newline- room was small  and not comfortable at all. -newline- the restaurant in the lobby  was  ok. you can try.

ReviewText:Went to LA for class reunion at the superior university in Los Angeles, which is closer to downtown than Westwood.  Standard is close to some of the newer hot spots.  Bottega Louie, LA Live, etc.  The hotel building has great history and the outdoor dining area is great for an urban setting.  Only negative on the trip was that key to my room was given to someone else who checked in later.  At about 2am, this person tried to get into the room. Luckily we had put the security bar on the door, otherwise this would have been ugly.  Hotel comp'd parking to make up for it.  All in, this was a good property and you get access to the rooftop bar, which is still happening.

ReviewText:I stayed at the Standard four nights for a business trip, arriving on a Saturday night when the "scene" at the hotel and its roof top bar were in full force. Aside from navigating around loud (but attractive) revelers in the elevator and the hallways, the hotel was a fun and unique experience for this single business traveler. Families and older couples may not enjoy as much. High design, clever details add to the experience. I had a large room, which was comfortable, despite the odd choice of placing the bed on a carpeted platform (basically on the floor.) Nice bath products, ample desk space, and the perk of spending Sunday morning sunning on the roof with a Bloody Mary and surveying the scene of [*] bikini babes, bachelorette parties and hipster [*] boys brunching and snacking.
