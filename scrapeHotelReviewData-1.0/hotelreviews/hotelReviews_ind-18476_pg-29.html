ReviewText:The location was great; Starbucks and Ralphs across the street...liked the free shuttle to/from the airport as well. -newline-  -newline- Other than that the hotel was not great. Very run-down hotel, staff not friendly and barely spoke English. I Pre-booked/bought 2 nights and I was so scared of the other sketchy hotel guests and the elevators omg. I literally thought I was not going to make it to my floor everytime I hoped on the elevator, Beware. I bought 2 nights but after the 1st night I went down the road and stayed at the Hilton LAX where I was very happy and felt safe and taken care of for like $20 more dollars a night. I would never recommend this hotel nor ever stay here again no matter the price.

ReviewText:this place was a terrible. I paid $100 for a room expecting three star comfort. I needed to be close to lax. When i checked in the girl was rude. Then parking was terrible, to far. Then as i walk to my room the carpet and smell was disgusting. then I get to the room and the room was disgusting. I just couldn do it! I just left and got a room a double tree about 30 min away. I lost $00. on the room but there is know way i could stay at this place. the pics look good. this is why i was so shocked. I would pay $50.00 for this place. Well i clearly took one for the team this time.

ReviewText:I had requested an ADA compliant room, which I suppose we got, however it was a good 3~5 minute walk from the lobby (with an 89 year old woman and a walker) and the worst of it was the 14" high bath tub she could not step into. the hand hold bars are not of much use if you cant get into the tub. Also the TV control DID NOT WORK, and the overall reception was not very great. The shuttle service was excellent, very convenient and the Drivers were very helpful with luggage. Mariposa Room was decent dining.
