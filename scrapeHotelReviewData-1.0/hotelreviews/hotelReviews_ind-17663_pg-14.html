ReviewText:My stay here was very pleasant except for a couple things. One of the two elevators for the Tower rooms was in serious need of maintenance. This was a relatively minor issue, and I reported it to the staff. The other, more serious issue, is parking. This hotel does NOT have enough parking to accommodate all of their clients on busy weekends. If you come in late, you will either be parking in the aisles or in the street, and most likely no where near to your room. -newline- The staff was very friendly and accommodating, handling an issue I had quickly and easily.

ReviewText:Went to check in at 5:45pm and the room was NOT ready. Location is right on the freeway and it is very noisy. The hotel was painting and there was plastic sheeting on everything including the fake grass and all windows. There were stains in the sink. And the air conditioning system wasn't working. You are right on the freeway. I booked there because it was pet friendly. I just came from another hotel which was so clean and welcomed my pet with treats, blankets, and toys its pet fee. This hotel does charge a pet fee but you get nothing, not even a bowl and there is no place to take your pet to do its business. I would not recommend that you walk outside of the hotel at night.

I agreed, my room pre paid through online for one night without being told to expect a seperate fee when I arrived. 4 days later the fee hit my cheching around, I called and the staff told me to call the bank. The bank said to call the hotel. I had a conference call with both. Still waiting for refund
