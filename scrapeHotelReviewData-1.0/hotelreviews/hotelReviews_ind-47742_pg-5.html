ReviewText:Very nice hotel but location was not so convenient; had to walk a lot or ask for hotel transportation which takes sometimes long, to get to areas of restaurants, shopping, etc.

ReviewText:This hotel experience was great! Stayed here over Labor Day Weekend and staff was very accommodating. The courtesy car came in handy since it picked us up from the train station, took us to LA Live and a few other places within 3 miles of the hotel. Only thing I didn't like was that there was no jacuzzi.

ReviewText:I'm often in Downtown LA but had never stayed at the Omni until my most recent trip. I will absolutely be back. Great room--immaculately clean, extremely comfortable bed, superb toiletries provided, and everything new and nice. The staff are great, from the efficient and courteous bellhops to the professional front desk personnel. And if you join their club, you get free WiFi, which is a huge bonus. Location is great and within walking distance of wonderful restaurants and the burgeoning Downtown lounge scene. Only (minor) downside is the hike up the hill to the hotel from most of Downtown, but you can avoid it if you use escalators through California Plaza.

ReviewText:the only bad thing about this stay is that the shower falls short of perfect. i am 5'1" and the shower head and the projection area was too high. if you want to take a shower and not wet your hair, good luck! it also covered the entire area. you had to shut off the water to apply soap/shampoo.

ReviewText:Stayed here as part of a trip down to Chavez Ravine. For a 4 star it was the best value in the area, good room size for 3 adults.

ReviewText:Stayed here for the night as part of a trip to Chavez Ravine. Staff from the valet to the check in was very helpful. A nice little bonus is the park from 500 Days of Summer was right across the street!
