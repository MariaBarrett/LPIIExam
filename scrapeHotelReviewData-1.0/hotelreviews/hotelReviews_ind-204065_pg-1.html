ReviewText:Booked a 5 night stay at the line hotel and I wouldn't have changed one thing! Everyone was super helpful and friendly and very accommodating. I didn't get a chance to eat at Pot but I must say the cafe has some delicious things. The room super clean and beautiful and the bed was sooo comfortable. I took advantage of the gym on the 4th floor too! Hope come back when they open the pool!

ReviewText:This hotel was everything we had hoped for and more! The staff was so helpful and friendly. The hotel is absolutely beautiful. It has such a modern feel from the moment you walk in to when you walk into your room. I would suggest to get the hollywood hills view, so beautiful! We will definitely be booking here again soon. The location was perfect! Fairly easy to get to places in the Los Angeles area. We rode the bikes to downtown Los Angeles and MacArthur park and it was not even a mile away. Loveeeee this hotel! Thank youu!!

ReviewText:The level of service at the Line Hotel can be summarized in one short story. The staff had gone the extra mile for anything that I needed. My husband and I wanted to attend the Clippers and Pistons game and the front manager (Rich) went out of his way and ordered the tickets for us and had them delivered immediately at such short notice. Nichole, the font office manager was especially helpful during our 4 day stay as well. Every time you walk in an out of the hotel, valets and the doorman greet you . The hotel asks when you would like to schedule your room to be cleaned. It was a level of service not often seen and greatly appreciated. This is a great hotel in a wonderful location. You won't be disappointed.

They were also having a grand opening of their restaurant "POT" the following evening and we got to meet Roi Choy! -newline-  -newline- The staff was extremly accomidating and the bar crowd was hip and trendy.

ReviewText:It is a very cool hotel, right in Korea town and one block from my favorite restaurant ever, the Boiling Crab. We stayed in the Hollywood View rooms.... definitely pay the extra money for these rooms, well worth it and you will not regret it. Floor to ceiling windows were insane. Two down sides of this hotel: 1. They charge 35$ per night for parking, but do not tell you about it until you are checking out. A little advance warning would be nice. and 2. They automatically charge $150 as a "deposit" for anything you may use or wreck in the room. It is refunded to you in about a week. Kind of a weird thing.... you have my credit card info, if I broke anything you can charge it after, not before. But overall I would definitely stay here again. Very glamorous and well done.

ReviewText:We visited for a quick overnight staycation in early March, only two months after Line opened. While there's still a lot that's soon to open (Commissary, Pot, Poketo#, what was already complete shows a lot of potential. Starting with the greeting at the valet, the service is Nordstrom-like in its attentiveness and courtesy. Alice at the front desk was absolutely great. Three people apologized for the wait to check in due to slow computers #all of maybe 3 minutes#, and we were upgraded to a higher-floor room for our trouble. The rooms are small but comfortable. Be careful you don't whack your head on the TV mounted near the bed. Floor-to-ceiling windows #and our view towards the Hollywood hills) make the room seem bigger than it is. The concrete walls ensure you won't hear your neighbors in the room next door. The overall aesthetic is modern and stripped down, though it would be nice to see more artwork on the walls. Drinks at the Pot bar were creative and strong, and the ever-helpful Alice gave us some great recommendations for local KBBQ. We'd visit again just to see how everything else turns out.
