ReviewText:I stayed here two nights. Check in and check out speedy and easy! Quiet, clean comfortable room. I stayed in the King Pure Room. I had a rental car overnight parking ran $18 a day and it's a little more to valet park.  This hotel had the most friendly staff all around! Every one was super helpful and went the extra mile when I needed assistance or had special requests. There is an AVIS rental inside the hotel. The pool and hot tub were well maintained.  I would stay here again if I needed to stay in Glendale. I had business in Burbank as well as Pasadena and this hotel put me in a perfectly strategic spot with easy access to both. [...]

ReviewText:Overall very acceptable hotel as such, but unfortunately, in the middle of downtown business area. It's fine if you're no there on business, but don't expect much atmosphere by way of ambiance.

ReviewText:My Nephew came to visit for Spring Break, so our visit to SoCal included popular tourist spots; Hollywood, Burbank, Century City, Disneyland and San Diego and the hotel was conveniently located to freeways making it easy to commute to these areas. The immediate area around the hotel was clean and you felt safe walking on the streets and the area offered a variety of restaurants, theaters and stores. The rooms were clean, quiet and the beds were comfortable. The cleaning staff did a good job cleaning, however, they failed to restock the shampoo for a 4-day visit and we had to request it. I have special medical and dietary needs and the hotel accommodated with delivering a refrigerator & microwave to the room at no extra charge. The hotel parking was a little high at $18 per day for self-park and $23 for valet.
