ReviewText:The buffet options is what confused me the most. Usually there is some kind of complimentary buffet for breakfast but I ended up paying way too much for the omelet buffet when all i wanted was a bagel and cereal.

ReviewText:This was a worthwhile hotel. Quality is about what you'd expect of a Courtyard--its good and that's why I choose them. -newline-  -newline- Staff was pleasant and helpful. -newline- Parking is at the hotel, but costs quite a lot--maybe that is true of all Los Angeles but it still gripes me. Breakfast is good and at a good price. -newline-  -newline- This was a very satisfactory experience.

ReviewText:Spend 3 days in Pasadena, loved the hotel, the staff and the location. It's only 2 blocks away from all shops and restaurants. I loved this town, if I ever go back I'll definitely stay at this hotel. I highly recommend

ReviewText:Close to rose bowl (that's what we wanted) - pool looked great, but we didn't use it. Lobby was beautiful (as were men working in lobby). Toilet seat was loose - asked for it to be tightened - was tightened and immediately got loose again. CHEAP - spend some of that money you spent on lobby on a good toilet seat please! 2nd bed had some internal spring damage - made noise whenever someone moved and was warped, so I felt like I was falling all night. People have previously complained about noise in reviews - but no noise from neighbors and slept with window open (facing freeway), but it didn't seem unnecessarily loud (but I'm from the city). We had wifi in room - worked great, as did internet access in lobby - 3 terminals. Appreciated having microwave and refrigerator in room. Finally, the self-park garage had multiple floors with parking on same level as room - so access was A+. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay.
