ReviewText:Cool hotel.  Great decor. Rooms not as nice as rest of the hotel.  Felt a little shabby inside.  Bathroom sink rattled away from wall.Noise from the hallways seeped into rooms.  Very loud.  Parking pretty crazy and that weekend streets were shut down do to event.  [...]Hotel Restaurants great.

ReviewText:Lobby and common areas fabulous.  Parking was $40 per day compared to $30/day at other downtown hotels.  No bathrobes, makeup mirrors, or glassware in rooms - unusual for a hotel in this caliber and price range.  Hotel service was very good none-the-less.  No shopping on nearby blocks.  I got my car in the garage but they ran out of room while I was staying there.

ReviewText:The hotel lost my reservation and I had to wait half an hour to check in while I called your hotline to get help.The problem was fixed by your operator or agent and then they allowed me to check in.also the room was ok but the  bathroom needs to be updated and the bath tub had rust in it...eeks if I had been staying there for any additional days I would have requested to have my room changed.The Japanese dining at Issi was not very good.Also the parking is very expensive $40 dollars a day,but the safe was very professional and nice.

ReviewText:Unfortunately my trip to LA was not for a happy occassion. There was death in the family. The Millenium Biltmore was not my first coice, but I do believe that it turned out to be the best choice. It is centrally located and there are many attractions that are accessible from it's location. The room was very comfortable and the Hotel itself is very eloquent. When I return to LA again the Millenium Biltmore will be my first choice.

ReviewText:This is the hotel where was filmed Ghostbuster and I think since then it has never been renewed!! -newline- The hotel is old style, outside is beautiful, but the structure is old, the windows have no curtains so the early morning sun lights up the rooms. Rooms on the lower floors that have windows on the square are very noisy: we were in a room at 3rd floor so we asked the staff to change the room for the 2nd night. They did it and we could sleep again. The hotel staff was nice, but I can't recommend this hotel because I think it's time to renewal!!

ReviewText:i only stayed one night but all of the staff were very courteous and helpful. the lobby, bar, and lounge areas are gorgeous. my room had a single king bed but wasnt anything amazing. i did note that the air conditioning units were hidden, which is a good change from other hotels ive stayed in. the bathroom could have been cleaner (hard water buildup on the shower head), but the rooms are old and i'm a super neat freak. my only issue is that the hotel itself does not offer free parking or free wireless internet in room. even so, i would definitely stay here again

ReviewText:Stately hotel in downtown LA.  Liked that it was close to a Metro Station.  This made it easy to get around without a car.

ReviewText:There was aproblem with my room because someone was smoking in a non-smoking room and the smoke permeated my room.  After reporting this, managment upgraded my room and moved all my luggage within fifteen minutes.  From there the hotel staff remained attentive and made sure my stay remained comfortable.  It was great!!!
