ReviewText:Decided to stay here valentines day. Thought this would be a good idea because it had resturant and roof top bar on premise. Upon arriving is my biggest gripe. Valet said it would be $35 or we could self park for $10. We werent being cheap we just didnt have much luggage and weren't planning on leaving anywhere so we decided to self park. When we tried we were told the lot was full and would have to valet. So i then self parked my car in valet and they said I would still be charged the $35. I didnt feel like arguing. At the check -in desk the attendant asked how our night was going and we told him our story. He then said very smugly "yeah its $35. No empathy from anyone here. We then went to the resturant which turned the night around. The fod was suprisingly very good and the waitress was amazing. I expected the basic room to be small and it was, but it could have used a good dusting. All in all I didnt see the value in staying here.

ReviewText:Perfect spot downtown for the young and hip. Hotel provides the perfect locale for roof top partying and close access to downtown venues. Rooms are very basic and while comparable to others in the area, overpriced based on room qualities. Bar noise travels very easily and even the free earplugs won't stop it from allowing a good night's sleep. The basic queen was roomy enough. I wouldn't pay more for a few more inches.

ReviewText:We used it only as a place to sleep one night. Supposedly they had upgraded us to a "nicer, larger room" but it was on the 2nd floor and the disco misic reverberated in the room until 2 a.m. Rooms and lobby are decorated in ultra modern but are not user-friendly. Bed on a platform was difficult for us older folks to get out of. Hotel's free wifi sucks. Wouldn't stay again.

ReviewText:It was a nice hotel with clean rooms and the roof top was beautiful! It was my birthday and the staff was nice enough to give me 2 drinks on them. It was a beautiful room and very classy and up to date

ReviewText:had a smoking room top floor with a brilliant view....open and very comfortable bed....compared to what i have paid 120 $ at other places the extra 80$ for the night here was well worth it.....WELL worth it. its a trendy spot with hipsters and a more party theme so if your looking for like a relax spot id say no otherwise it was bang on

ReviewText:Had a great experience. Staff at front desk was nice/attentive. Room service food was very good, reasonably priced. Rooms were kitschy but cool. Rooftop pool/bar was unique. Could hear loud music in room at night (assume it was coming from roof), but in this hotel, it's almost expected (and they provide ear plugs). Not a hotel to bring kids!! -newline-  -newline- Only complaint was the free wi-fi; it was spotty and I couldn't stream video without lots of annoying hiccups and it kept freezing some sites I use for work on my phone -- I ended up just turning off my mobile wi-fi -- worked much better (they offered a $9.95 upgrade, but in my mind if you offer free wi-fi, make it quality or just don't offer it). -newline-  -newline- All in all, it was a great stay.

ReviewText:We are an older couple, so while a stall shower is best, the fact of being in a glass rectangle with no grab bars or slip prevention flooring created stress. We had to ask for a second chair. And a raised bed on a platform is dangerous for us old folks. But we knew it was a hotel for the young, so we managed. But if you are over 55, you might want accommodations elsewhere. -newline- The best gift was Caffee Primo down the street. Reasonable and delicious!

ReviewText:As soon as we arrived, we knew that it was one hipster hotel that accommodates to the younger crowd. That is what we expected and hoped for anyway, so it worked out. The staff was fantastic and courteous, the room was clean and organized, etc. Some complain that this place is not as nice as priced, but it is downtown Los Angeles after all. Overall, good experience, not amazing.
