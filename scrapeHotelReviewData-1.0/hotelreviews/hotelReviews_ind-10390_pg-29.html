ReviewText:The rooms are dingy, old, and not clean.  There was mildew in the bathroom, dustballs around the outlets, and a general worn look in the room.    As a business traveler, I expected wireless internet in my room.  The wired connection in my room didn't work and I was forced to use the business center which charged me $45 for about an hour!

ReviewText:The Millenium Biltmore has great decor and reminiscent of the old grand hotels. The public spaces are wonderfully decorated, but the rooms are relatively small more reminiscent of hotel rooms in Europe.  The restaurants are expensive,even the informal cafe.  I recommend Sai Sai, a wonderful Asian Fusion restaurant. Not many other choices outside the hotel for eating on weekends, as downtown closes up.   I found the level of service very good, and the people at the front desk helpful.

ReviewText:This is an amazing hotel property.    As you enter and walk through the main areas you can clearly see that this was once the best hotel in LA.          The Hotel Staff was friendly and the location was central to both business and pleasure.      The management of the hotel have done a good job, but they will need to try a little harder to make this a sought after destination.        The good news for them is that they are almost there.          Areas for improvement are almost all limited to the passage ways from the grand main areas to your room.    Proper heating and cooling in the corridors and some artwork would go a long way.

ReviewText:The Millennium Biltmore was nicely decorated.  The hotel room itself was very small but it was nicely decorated and most importantly clean. The hotel bar was a nice, lively lounge.  The location was good (not a bad area) but we found the hotel seemed farther away from touristy attractions than expected.

ReviewText:We stayed three nights at the Millennium Biltmore and were very satisfied with the room. The hotel staff was very friendly and correct. The hotel has an impressive reception hall with a luxury feel.       The room we had was on the ninth floor and offered a nice view on Pershing Square. The room was relatively spacy, the beds were very good, the bathroom had all we wanted.      The only backdraw was the 32 USD a night valet parking fee. The hotel in in downtown LA, but close to highway 1010 which connects to the 10 and the 101. To Hollywood or to Santa Monica by car takes about 20 to 25 minutes which we thought wasn't a big deal.

ReviewText:The Hotel is a beautiful property located in downtown L.A.  Our choice was based on proximity to Dodger Stadium, less than 3 miles away.  The one-way streets can complicate the drive but get a good map!  The room was large and very clean.  The A/C was more than adequate but was a bit noisy.  It is a old property and the bathrooms are a bit dated.  Our biggest complaint - the shower curtain blows into the shower and sticks to you while showering.

ReviewText:The Millenium Biltmore was excellant value for money. The staff service was excellant but I am disappointed in the lack of full internet service by it not having an smtp acount so that i could send out emails. I would have expected a hotel of this level to have a better internet and wireless system. I found the room very clean and neat if a little worn around the edges due to its age. The public areas were outstanding along with the resturants.     The location was easily accessable to the hiway and to the downtown area.

ReviewText:The Biltmore is a beautiful 1920s building in a rapidly changing downtown LA. The lobby, bar, and other public areas have outstanding period looks that are in lots of movies and tv. The pool (which looks like William Randolph Hearst may have had a pool party there) and health club are top notch with steam and sauna. There are some loose ends, though. There is no wireless, no minibars or refrigerators, and some of the rooms are a bit shabby. Overall a really good value for the price and location. A great old bookstore, Caravan, is on the same block.
