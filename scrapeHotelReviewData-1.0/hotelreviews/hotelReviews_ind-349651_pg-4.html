ReviewText:This hotel is convienently located across the street from LA Live and the Staples Center.  There is also lots of great dining all within walking distance.  A great, affordable place to stay downtown LA close to a lot of attractions.

ReviewText:The Holiday Inn Los Angeles City Center has an extremly pleasant staff.  They were very helpful in dinning recommendations and directions.   The parking attendants were extremely nice.  We were there for the XGames and had a very enjoyable expereince.   There are several large hotel hains in that area, but if visiting again, I would certainly choose the Holiday Inn.

ReviewText:This was not the top of the line Holiday Inn and it should be.  The staff provided timely service but they were not always accurate or friendly.  They will help arrange rides and provide wake up calls, even though those calls come in 10-15 minutes later than the request.      Two major problems to look out for.  The sheets cause skin to become red and chaffed so I would recommend bringing your own pillow cases.      Priority Club members do NOT get anything for breakfast and must pay a restaurant fee.  They were to give a 5% discount in the restaurant to Priority members but failed to do so until I requested it at checkout.  The menu is the same as all other Holiday Inns so you are paying for nothing special.        The overall cleanliness could have been up a notch and the amenities in the bathroom were almost nonexistent.

ReviewText:The carpet was extremely dirty with many spots.      The first night I found to be a little chilly.  The heating system did not go on when I turned it on.  I called the desk for help.  I was informed that some one would be sent up.  No one ever came and I did not call again.      On my third night I could not sleep due to the extremely loud blaring of the TV in a room next to my room.  I called the desk and asked that someone  talk to the occupant of this room.  The blaring continued for a long time after my desk call.  I finally got up and found a pair of earplugs in my suitcase.  Using the earplugs was of some help in sleeping.

ReviewText:I picked this Holiday Inn primarily due to the convenient location to Staples Center.  But I found that our stay was very comfortable, valet parking made things very easy, the staff was friendly.  The room is pretty standard but had all the comforts we needed, like a comfortable bed and nice pillows!  Staples Center is pretty much right across the street so that made it extra easy for us before and after the event.  I would stay here again on my next visit to Staples Center!

ReviewText:英語の話せない私にも、みなさん親切に対応してくださりました。 -newline- 近くには大型スーパーもあって便利でした。 -newline- あと、ホテルから毎日チョコと、ペットボトルの水が２本部屋に置かれていてありがたかったです。 -newline- 空港からホテルへのシャトルバスはありません。 -newline- でもまたダウンタウンに遊びに行く際には泊まりたいホテルです。
