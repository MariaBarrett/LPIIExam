ReviewText:There is too much to say about this place, the staff was very nice (open doors, greeted us, etc), the housekeeping was impeccable and even accommodated us when we didn't leave the room until 4pm one day :) -newline- The only issue was a very small one, and they more than made up for it. When we arrived in the room, we noticed some sort of pastry on top of the mini-fridge, opened and partial eaten. We called to let them know that wasn't cool, they apologized profusely, came up to get rid of it, and when we came back from dinner we found a bottle of wine and fruit/cheese/cracker plate waiting for us to make up for the situation. That was the above and beyond expectations moment!

ReviewText:Overall, I had an absolutely wonderful experience. Te staff was great, beautiful hotel, clean room, comfortable, and great view being higher up. -newline- My only issues was that housekeeping came back to my room about three times before noon on my check out date and parking is pretty expensive. That would be a deciding factor if I stay again.

ReviewText:I was a little disappointed with this hotel compared to Omni San Diego. It felt like it needed a major update. I could just see my grandparents staying there with the outdated d√©cor. The room was nice enough, but it was not nearly as nice and modern as the Omni SD. My only real complaint was you could hear all noise in the hallway a little too clearly... Very average overall.

ReviewText:I was thoroughly astounded, so I feel I have to give props to the Omni Hotel. I honestly hadn't expected much because their weekend rate was a fraction of the price of the other downtown hotels, but the Omni truly delivered... -newline-  -newline- Here's How: #1 As soon as we checked in, Karen at the front desk wished me a happy birthday; #2 She scheduled a last minute mani/pedi for me, then proceeded to print out walking directions to the salon in Little Tokyo; #3 The room was comfy and had an awesome view of the Hollywood sign... not only did the bathroom have great lighting, which could be a bad thing depending on how you look at it, but it also had a beautiful shower and separate spacious tub; #4 When we stopped back at the room to shower, the staff was waiting for us so they could deliver a complimentary chilled bottle of champagne and a cheese plate for my b-day; #5 There are tons of markets, restaurants, etc in walking distance, if you can handle a 10% incline, plus a nice fountain/courtyard next to the building; #6 The cab stand was always loaded and ready to take our drunken party to wherever we were going; #7 There's an awesome restaurant and lounge in the hotel with outdoor seating and heating.... at night they even had a charming piano player/singer belting out hours of non-stop tunes for the eclectic happy and/or drunken patrons; #8 You can trust them with your GTR. Valet was easy and their team was super professional; #9 I forgot why I started making this list; #10 The front lobby is always stocked with ice cold fruit-infused waters for their guests... So plan on saving your water bottles and fill up!

ReviewText:The hotel was comfortable, clean and quiet. Staffs are really nice, my flight has been delayed, I called them thy put me on the late check in list, and they work very efficiently. Even they don't have free wifi for Normal Guest, but you could go to their website to join the select guest for free, then you get 6M high speed free wifi. They also ask what kind of room do you like when you update your Select guest profile, such like what kind of pillow, clean room everyday or just when you call, and the location of your room( elevator or corner)

Food was good and fast for room service (20 minutes or less)Shower was hot, the bathrooms are actually heated so even if its hot and you have the air on, once you step out of the shower your nice and toasty. Great stay

ReviewText:I booked a room at the Omni for a friend's birthday. The staff was friendly and check in/out was very fast. The room was clean and comfortable, no complaints! Not crazy about paying $30 for valet (per night), but it is what it is...convenience. I would stay here again.
