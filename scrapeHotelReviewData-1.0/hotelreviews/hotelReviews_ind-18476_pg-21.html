ReviewText:More than a little shopworn, and it's clean enough, and shuttle service is prompt and courteous.

ReviewText:Staff was not friendly nor helpful. Bathroom was dirty on check in. Positive restaurant and club on site so no need to go far. You have to pay for parking so that should be disclosed on site. Parking across the street.

ReviewText:Check in was delayed due to the previous person had not checked out and we were not notified. Had to change rooms upon check in. The noise level during the a.m. hours were horriable. 3.a.m. noise from hall way, room next door and outside at the pool kept us up. I would not ever encourage anybody else to stay there. Very dissapointed.

ReviewText:This hotel is beautiful--relaxing courtyards, clean and modern common areas, fun bar, yummy restaurant, and friendly staff. We could have remained in the hotel for our entire stay and had a relaxing weekend. Across the street there are a large selection of restaurants, a pharmacy, a grocery store, coffee shops--everything one might need. We were worried about the air traffic noise because it's only a half mile from the airport, but we didn't hear a thing. We will definitely stay there again!

ReviewText:The lady at the front desk was very very rude. Maybe she was having a bad day, I don't know but she was very very unwelcoming. As soon as we got into our room we were hit with a strong hit wind of air that smelled like an old wet moldy carpet. We got only two towels in the bathroom- no hand towels or face towels. The bath tub was filthy! There were dark moldy slimy spots in the tub and only one soap, in a room that's supposed to be a double room. The floors made loud squeaky noises when you walk. The floor was so bad that it shook the entertainment stand- old stand with 24 inch tube television that turned on on its own. The ceiling had cracks and small leaks. The sheets were clean, I guess. I don't recommend this hotel, specially at 100/night.
