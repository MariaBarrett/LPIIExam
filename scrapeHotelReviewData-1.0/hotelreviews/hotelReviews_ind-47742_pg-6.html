ReviewText:I stayed from the 13 to 14 and decided to extend my stay an aditional day until de 15th. I'ts located in the heart of Downtown L.A. Wich it dies at night but that's ok because we were going out in Hollywood. The lobby and hallways smelled delicious, and their fruit water at the lobby was exelent. I'll defenetly stay here again, or try another one in the country.

ReviewText:Only disappointment was on Saturday we had our "privacy" sign on the door. Housekeeping placed a card under the door to call when we needed our room cleaned. Did so at 1:45pm and told them we would be leaving at 2:00 and be gone the rest of the day. Arrived back about 11:00pm to a still uncleaned room. Called down Sunday morning for clean towels, etc. and they were delivered immediately.

ReviewText:Hotel is very nicely appointed. Beautiful seating area outside for drinks and appetizers. Would have liked outlets on the desk, and or complimentary computer time. Had an excellent filet in the dining room. Would definitely go back

ReviewText:Received a great online deal for this hotel in the heart of downtown L.A.. Great proximity to L.A. Live (Staples Center, Nokia Theater, entertainment, food, drinks, etc) and the hotel even offers complimentary car service there! One think to mention is you should be certain to reserve the car service early. There was a 45 minute wait when we requested service. Otherwise, the Omni Hotel is a very elegant hotel with superb staff and nicely maintained rooms. I would definitely stay there again.

The service was also seamless. -newline-  -newline- Would definitely stay here again!

ReviewText:Omni hotel was great. -newline- When we first arrived to the hotel, my family and i knew it was going to be a great stay. Staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. -newline- Once we got into the room, everything was so clean. -newline- Parking is $20 per night, but we figured, it was worth it at this hotel. -newline- Will definitely be back at this hotel.

ReviewText:I found it funny while waiting at the entrance of the lobby. Was dressed for the Opera and people would come up to me and and ask me for information. I normally look at all aspects of the hotel I'm staying at was was quite helpful. I'm Hispanic and most of the staff was Hispanic, normal conclusion.
