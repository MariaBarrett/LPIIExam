ReviewText:An amazing hotel, right in the heart of Hollywood Boulevard, the lobby is amazing (I'm told Shirley Temple learned to tap dance on the tiles steps there!) and the food at the cafe, 25 degrees was awesome, open 24 hours. Conscierge and Reception extremely helpful, the room contemporary and suited our needs. The only thing we can fault was that they charged extra for internet usage - but we found we could go to the coffee shop across the street to use it for free!! Parking was pricey, but understandable in this location. Roosevelt Certainly the accommodation highlight of our trip.

ReviewText:It was a very stylish hotel in an excellent location.  We enjoyed our stay.  The only negatives are that nothing is really included in your stay except for housekeeping.  You must pay to park your car in the lot, pay to make a local phone call, pay to do anything really.  The drinks at the Tropica were very expensive.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay because of the location and history of the hotel.  If I ever return to LA, I will probably stay at one of the beaches.

ReviewText:I live in LA, bf does not, and wanted to spend a full day/late night in Hollywood.  Great way to "experience" Hollywood by staying the night at The Roosevelt.  It's a Hollywood landmark (don't let the outside fool you~ even though I LUV the old hotel sign, esp  at night). -newline- Considered The Renaissance, Marriott across the street @ Hollywood & Highland (same price range), but it's more for those in town w/ fam, business, or staying longer than a weekend.  The Roosevelt crowd is 25-35, single, trendy, and a little bit "vegas".  Also, considered The Standard off Sunset, but friends gave poor reviews  (not to be mistaken for The Standard, downtown LA, very good reviews).  Only thing about location for The Roosevelt is it's not on Sunset strip, but there's taxis on stand-by, so nbd.  Valet prkg a MUST, and yes it's about $30/day, but consider the location, that's normal for ANY hotel in a major downtown city. -newline- Recommend a room w/ poolside view (not what we got b/c we wanted a lil' privacy but fun for people-watching & being up in the "mix").  Bathrooms are small, ours only had half a shower door (that was the "look", suppose to be modern?), tight fit for 2 in shower, no counter-space (had to do make-up/hair on floor in front of full length mirror).  Hotel has 24hr room service (limited menu but theres a 24hr burger joint downstairs), and minibar (but stock ur own supply for obvious rea$on$). -newline- We were cheesy and did an ALL-morning "Grand Tour" LA tour (via Starline tours).  I ended up liking it b/c my bf got to see ALL of the important sites (HW Bowl, Kodak Theatre, Chinese Theater, Rodeo Drive, La Brea Tar Pits, Olvera St, Farmer's Market/the Grove, Disney Music Hall, etc.) w/out relying on me to get him there (plus, I don't know the "history/facts" like the tour guide).  It picked us up across the street at the Graumann's Chinese theater so we valet our car early in the morning (8am) and hotel held our bags until we were ready to check in later (tour ended about 2-3p).  You spend about 20mins at each location &  if we wanted we could drive back to a spot that we liked afterwards (nothing's really too far from hotel).  It's about $60pp but still worth it one time, esp for those who aren't from LA.  And I've been to those places many times but still ended up learning or seeing something I never knew. -newline- Before going out at night, I recommend having cocktails around the bar areas at The Roosevelt, very loungy-feel.  If staying on a friday nite have dinner at Cafe WAS b/c (Ivan Kane's) 40 Deuces closed in Hollywood about 2yrs ago and Cafe WAS now has the girls on fri nites (burlesque dancers~ the sexiest ones in LA area), there's 2 shows.  You don't need to have dinner to see girls (but good luck having a view at the bar).  Get a good spot and make a dinner reservation.

ReviewText:Everything was ok until we opened the door.  Three people were in the room.  They said they were just showing the room.  I can't see why, rug worn and dirty looking, worn furniture, too sterile and spartan.  Room full of "stuff" to buy.  Even the morning coffee you make your self was $3.50 a cup. -newline- We'll never return.

ReviewText:Historic building centrally located to all Hollywood sights, venues, shopping, dining and clubs. Needs a bit of building renovation, paint on bathroom floors was chipping, old shower fixture was stuck. Friendly and professional staff. Standard rates a bit pricey, great hotel if they are running special room rates, ie via [...], etc.

ReviewText:My husband and I traveled across I-10 from FL to CA & stayed at 3 B&B's, 2 Super 8's & the Roosevelt.  THE WORST exp. was by far the Roosevelt, where we were told there were no reservations (staff blamed [...], or anyone else they could for the "error"), denied access to our vehicle and pointed to areas we wanted to see (the pool, the Marilyn mirror on 2nd floor, lounge).  I was told that the confirmation that I printed would not do me any good, as I was trying to show it to the desk clerk to let her know that we did indeed have reservations.  We prepaid for two weekend nights and one weekday night, excluding tips and parking, and the clerk handed us a charge summary which included the very day we were checking out, which we had already paid for but were told was not reserved for us.  We asked to speak to a manager and were told that the manager was on the phone so we would have to wait.[...]the last evening, which is the Roosevelt's responsibility, is still not refunded to my credit card, and that was five days ago.  Had we flown into CA to spend the entire stay there, our vacation would have been ruined.  The stars of the show were the lowly bellhops, valets and housekeeping staff who were all gracious and helpful.Also, everything is charged....no complimentary coffee, water or parking.  I'm surprised they don't charge for the toilet paper useage.

ReviewText:Let me start by saying that this was an amazing hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking to stay on the strip. But there are a few things you should know before you book. [...] you have one and only one option when it comes to parking your car; valet, that's it, no self parking. What you are not told when you book is that it's 30 dollars a nightâ€¦!!! Why this is not included in the room price I'm not sure but it was not very cool. My last and final word of advice is that the Hotel bar (Paradise pool bar) is WAY, WAY ,WAY overpriced. I ordered two drinks (7&7 and a Gin & Tonic) and was charged 30, yes you read that right, 30 dollars!!! A bottle from the room fridge was 32 dollars. Not to mention it was the worst 7&7 and Gin & Tonic I have ever tasted in my life. Not sure how you can screw up a drink that has two ingredients but this bartender managed to do so. My wife and I ended up going up the street to the Pig & Whistle and had a blast. I highly recommend ditching the overpriced hotel bar and hit the P&W. Like I said at the start of this review, the Hotel is a great place to stay, just not to park or drink.

ReviewText:The hotel is rather generic.  There are no "extras," really. No coffee, no extra towels or pillows, only one bathrobe per room.  The rooms are small, the beds are comfortable.  The hallways are dark, and getting to the room involved walking a maze of them.  The staff is friendly enough.  I can't say I recommend the hotel or that I would stay there again.  The pool area is a club at night, so if you want a quiet night's rest, don't stay here.  If you're up for a night of partying in Hollywood, this place will do. Not great, but not bad.
