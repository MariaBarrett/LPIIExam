ReviewText:The room was just fine with an open view,,,location worked well.      The food in the restaurant was fine but very expensive. Breakfast for two was over $50. The service there was great.      The concierge was not very good.  We asked for other restaurants in the neighborhood and his suggestion was Houstonsin the mall.  Houstons is a hamberger joint, crowded, noisy.  He did not mention the Asian restaurant across from Houstons that was sensational and not pricey.      We were there for a wedding so didn't explore.

ReviewText:The Hyatt Century Hotel is about a 30 mins drive from LAX.  It is situated close to beverly hills and there is a mall/ theatre across the street.  Overall the neighborhood is well maintained and safe.  The hotel is well maintained as well and the staff are friendly, it is what you come to expect from Hyatt.

ReviewText:The hotel and staff were great. My room was like a mini studio apt. The bathroom was made for royalty. It was huge, I could have fit another bed inside. However, the water pressure in our room could have been a little stronger. There was no fridge in the room but you could request one, as well as a microwave, from guest services. Be aware that you have to pay for the internet connection. The location was perfect for us. We were minutes away from the Santa Monica Poer, Venice Beach, Universal Studios, Beverly Hills, and much more.

ReviewText:Beautiful, neat and comfortable place.      However, the failure of the Hotel to allow free mobile internet is a big minus. I called the Hotel before leaving NY to ask about wireless Internet access and they assured me they have. They did not say I would be charged for the access. I came with my laptop but it was an extra load because for the five nights I stayed at th Hyatt Regency, I never broused the Internet.       Not good for business!

ReviewText:The Hyatt Regency Century Plaza was first class all the way! The workers were very helpful especially when we were trying to visit the attractions such as NBC, Hollywood Blvd and Rodeo Dr. The view was spectacular as well. Best Spring Break/Birthday celebration!

ReviewText:We enjoyed the stay overall, but the breakfast restaurant was overcrowded and the staff could not keep up. Everybody was friendly and apologetic but it still took over 40 min to get our food.  The lobby bar staff was very friendly and efficient. The waitress in the night-bar was obnoxious and wouldn't leave us alone.   The room was very nice and comfortable. Door, Parking and Bell staff were great.   I would stay there again but eat and drink somewhere else.

ReviewText:After receiving a warm reception, I anticipated great follow through.  The housekeeper refused to provide me with additional towels and made me call housekeeing.  Even they could not understand this.  The carpet between the beds was very stained.  The bell staff was fine and very helpful.  The daily parking rate was very high.

ReviewText:Being from Chicago, one can have a a pretty solid list of standards when it comes to hotel rooms. The Hyatt Regency Century Plaza, met many of mine- great views, pools, room comfort and quality and staff hospitality.  For the urbanite in me, the decor of the room was very simple but with just enough posh to remind me that i'm not at home-rich cherry wood accents, a plush bed, a view of the mountains, abstract art pieces throughout the entire room.  My room came equipped with and ipod/ihome entertainment port, high speed internet, a safe, fridge and minibar/snack case. The hotel is also very pet and event friendly. Theres is also a bar/lounge within the hotel, that appears to be a hot spot for both guests and natives, alike. LA is a big place, so many things to see and do, the Hyatt made it very easy and accessible to many of the sights and attractions.  I already intend on making reservations here upon my next LA trip!
