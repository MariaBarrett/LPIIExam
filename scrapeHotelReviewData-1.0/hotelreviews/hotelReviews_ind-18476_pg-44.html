ReviewText:Pros and cons.  There for business.  Location was much better than those places right off airport.  This had access to more immediate restuarants, food and coffee joints.  However - it was clearly a very old place, and despite some well intentioned efforts to update it - the age of this place shown thru.  However, the rooms are not bad with decent desk and free wifi (not $10 a night like other larger chains off LAX).   All in all, a good value thru location and amenities - despite some elderly crumbling goin on.  Staff was excellent by the way !

ReviewText:I believe this hotel will be our new get-away spot. There was a lovely patio garden with tall Boston ferns. The food provided by the voucher system was very good. It was easy to get to, perfect for the weary traveler. The beach is just a few miles away. Housekeeping services are promt and proffessional. All told  we had a fantastic time!

ReviewText:I needed an inexpensive hotel next to LAX.  I wasn't looking for all the bells and whistles just a clean room with a bed as this was just for one night.  The bed wasn't the most comforatble (no pillow top) but I wasn't expecting it for the price.  If i needed something longer, I would probably choose something different, but this was fine for me for one night.

ReviewText:Very nice hotel close to airport with comp shuttle service. Excellent cooked to order breakfast. Great for one night. Rooms not very soundproof but otherwise would recommend and stay there again.

ReviewText:Arrived in the late evening and was off to the airport by 6:30 the next morning.  Area seemed ok for a short stay, but it's near LAX!  Bed was pretty hard, as were the pillows.  But, shuttle was great, and they still had room service at 10 pm.  So, all in all, for an airport overnight, it was fine.

ReviewText:We have often stayed here before a long trip as they offer a reasonable park & fly deal.  [...] The meeting we attended was only one mile away and with the location this couldn't be beat.

ReviewText:We enjoyed the indoor out door lobby and courtyard.  The hotel was full of European you were stranded in La due to the Volcano but the staff remained friendly and helpful.  Nice restaurant next door for breakfast.  Average room, looking old but adequate.
