ReviewText:Disappointed for the price we had to pay. Someone had removed the refrigeration we had expected to be there. The bedding smelled bad & had to be changed.

ReviewText:Great location for my business trip. The hotel was amazing, especially the outside garden experience. The room was exceptional, and had all amenities one could need. Only issue was that the room I was given already had someone in it when I almost walked in on them. Good that the TV was blaring and stopped me. The front desk graciously gave me another room on a higher floor with a better view.

ReviewText:Not a bad location for downtown LA. Near Phillipes for the best beef dips in history. Walking distance to a fun bar, The Edison. Some construction outside and parking a pain in the underground, especially on Sunday with Church services in the hotel. Basically, it worked. Would stay there again if I needed to be in downtown LA.

ReviewText:This hotel was conveniently located near the fashion district. They also have a complimentary van that takes you within 3 miles of their hotel and the drivers were very nice. The hotel itself was nice and clean. The workers at the front desk were nice and helpful.

ReviewText:The front desk staff had to do a lot of work to overcome certain deficiences. No hot water, a REALLY noisy AC system, and a business center that struggled with basic business shipping was annoying. Still the staff was helpful and friendly and I hope those things will be fixed. Still, I won't be staying there anytime soon.

ReviewText:I really enjoyed my experience here. Especially notable was the staff - starting from the parking area to the front desk staff and others. Rooms are a little small, but clean and everything was in working order. For the value in an area so close to everything in downtown, it can't be beat.

ReviewText:The hotel was nice. i was impressed with the location of the hotel as well as the interior decor. The room was spacious, disappointed that there was no mini bar, but everything else was just right. Very comfortable beds. The Azalea restaurant was a bit of a disappointment, and the other restaurants were not even open.
