ReviewText:After a long trip in motorcycle from Dallas, visiting various national parks, LA was my place to rest, before coming back. But in this hotel I was literally eaten by bugs. I toll them but they played incredulity. Later I saw next to the cleaning lady it was a man with a mask and poisoning tools.

ReviewText:Im a local, so when I booked this hotel in El Segundo I actually expected the rooms to be nicer than they were. My bathroom door didn't close properly, the paint was pealing from the wall, and door to enter our room didn't close either. The room was clean but it did have a certain smell to it. Almost like they used an aerosol to mask the smell of cigarettes. The employees were extremely nice however, so thats always good. The hotel is centrally located from several restaurants and stores that within walking distance. All in all it was pleasant stay but I probably wouldn't stay at the hacienda hotel if I had the choice.

ReviewText:I like this hotel in El Segundo, I have stayed several time on short business trips. It is close to LAX but not right on top of it. It is very close to freeways, there is a fridge in the room and the Mariposa restaurant is good. There are supermarkets, Starbucks and restaurants across the street and a Walgreens one block down. El Segundo offers a free lunch time shuttle into the center of town between 11.30am and 2pm. It is good for the office staff close to Grand Avenue and close to the Hacienda for pick up and drop off. The drivers are really helpful and Main St. El Segundo has some nice cafes. If you have a car, its, less than a mile or so to the beach. This and the great pool at the Hacienda helps you forget the proximity to industrial operations. The room was clean, very comfortable bed. What more can I say? I will go back again. Oh yes, they have an airport shuttle too.

ReviewText:Hotel stay very nice. price great through [website]. The only drawback was to use the computer--there would be a minimum of $5.95 charge. All I would have liked was to print out my boarding pass; and despite the note that said minimum $1 fee, it is really a minimum $5.95. -newline- Preset, but hardy breakfast came with the stay. Staff was very helpful.

ReviewText:this was a trip to my son's college graduation.  When we arrived at the hotel, the room we were assigned had not been cleaned.  We were given another room which was small and smelled stale.  Beacause we did not have a lot of time, we took the room and bought candels to freshen the room.when checking in they did not tell us where parking was and when I inquired at the desk, they treated me with suspicion, which was very unnerving. after returning to our room for the evening we heard a scratching at the door and someone was trying to enter our room.  I went to the door and realized they had given our room to another person.  When we let the front desk know, they apoligized and gave us free breakfast chits.  Something that was already included inour package.[...]
