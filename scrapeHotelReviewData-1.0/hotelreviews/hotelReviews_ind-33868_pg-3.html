ReviewText:It was my second stay at the Beverly Hilton and this time around it was even better. The day after my arrival I noticed the air conditioning in my room was exceptionally too loud to bear even in the day time (unbearable at night) so the front desk manager gave me a complementary upgrade to a deluxe room in the newly renovated adjacent tower. I was thrilled. Every staff member is courteous and eager to please you in every way possible. The location is super central. There is a bus stop right down the street on Wilshire Blvd where I took the bus to go to West Hollywood and Hollywood for fun every day. The bus runs every 10 minutes and the fare is only $1.50: big savings compared to taxi fares. There is a Starbucks right around the corner and Rodeo Drive is just a few walking blocks away. It's the perfect place to stay. I highly recommend it!
