ReviewText:It was a decent experience. The staff was very friendly and provided everything that we needed for our stay. I was surprised that the decor of the hotel was so outdated.

ReviewText:Location, location, location. Walking distance from Universal studios and City Walk. Close to restaurants, shopping or just strolling. Had a good time. Room was spotless, (to be expected), unbelievable view of Universal Studios from our room. Very spacious. Friendly staff. Concierge helped us plan our vacation in LA. Only disappointment is you have to pay for parking and no free access to a computer although free internet access in your room if you have a laptop.

ReviewText:The hotel was great.  It is right up the hill from the Universal City Red line Metro station, which will take you through Hollywood and into downtown.  There is an In-n-Out down the street within walking distance, and the area is very safe.  The hotel is right across from City Walk, much closer than the nearby Sheraton. -newline-  -newline- The only negative is that it sits atop a very steep hill, which is tough to walk up.  Luckily, a shuttle runs that will take you to City Walk, and you can cross to the hotel there.
