ReviewText:The location is super convenient to the West side and the Valley. The staff is pleasant. The rooms are clean. The only drawback is the noise from the freeway and late night diners at the nearby Denny's.

ReviewText:We stayed one night. The room was clean, decently appointed, and completely serviceable. The area is OK, but noisy -- traffic noise, in particular. I'm glad we didn't need to/plan on staying longer.

ReviewText:I stayed one night here during my very first visit to LA. Reached too late and staying here helped me relax. And Denny's is right next to it for an amazing breakfast.

ReviewText:Upon check-in, the guy could not find my reservation, so I stood there until he could figure it out. I was immediately given an upgrade for the wait. I appreciated that. The room was nice and clean. I didn't have a "do not disturb" sign in my room, so at 8:30 every morning, I was woken up by the housekeeping staff. This was not pleasant as I am not a morning person. When booking the room, I was supposed to have complimentary breakfast. I called the front desk and the guy was rude and said I would have to speak to the manager. I walked to the front desk and the front desk manager wasn't there. Okay? I showed him my reservation on my phone and he gave me my breakfast passes. -newline- The walls are super thin so don't be surprised when you can hear entire conversations, or better yet, screaming children in the room next to you, along with the noise above you if you're assigned a room on the first floor. -newline- The gentleman I dealt with at checkout was great...too bad I didn't interact with him sooner. -newline- My most satisfying part of the stay was going to Denny's (which is what the free breakfast is valid). The staff there was friendly and accommodating. Even though my breakfast was free, it didn't stop the staff from providing excellent service. So thank you Denny's for making the stay tolerable.

ReviewText:The hotel was very good It was clean I liked the Dennys right in front saved time in the morning the only thing that disappointed me was the hotel has NO shuttle service to the airport and I spent alot of money on going to the hotel in Sherman oaks and going back to the LAX airport The hotel has a van but does not use it apparently for guests I would love that to change than I would absolutely stay there again

ReviewText:Location is good to move through LA, near major FWYs, and room is OK. Some car noise from near streets can be unconfortable. Overall a good cost x benefit.

ReviewText:We were able to get an early check in thanks to the staff at the moment, the location is really easy to get to and near the freeway makes it a little convenient too, you get 10% off dennys as a guest only draw back for me was price
