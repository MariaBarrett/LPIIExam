ReviewText:Hotel Manager Ben and front desk clerk Jessica were some of the most professional and accomodating hotel employees ive seen in a while. I was treated as if i was friends with the owner. I stay in hotels alot and i must say...finding customer service like this doesnt always happen. It may be a 3 star hotel but its 5 star treatment. Highly recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:The lobby was nice but the room was extremely outdated. Had wet carpet in the room from a leaking pipe and it took two days of me complaining to the front desk before they offered to put me in another room. the location was great but the room not so much.

ReviewText:Hotel is close to the LAX airport and the 405 fwy making access to several locations a breeze. (short cut to beach - avoiding the fwy which is always jammed - is to travel west on Jefferson) Staff was always pleasant and they generously provided us with their warm cookies whenever asked. Had a minor issue with an electrical outlet that was remedied in minutes of my call and technician was also courteous. There were 4 in our group and we would definitely stay there again. I had believed breakfast was included with my reservation but it had not been (this may have been an over-site in the booking agent?). That was a bummer since their buffet looked great but cost $19 a person which was a bit high for my budget just for breakfast.

ReviewText:Booked into a handicapped room. Not handicapped-amenable, you actually needed to be handicapped to use it. For instance, one needed to kneel in the shower to wet their hair. The excuse was that we booked through a third party and that's what you get. Finally, they changed the room and things got better. Very average, except the breakfast buffet was excellent.
