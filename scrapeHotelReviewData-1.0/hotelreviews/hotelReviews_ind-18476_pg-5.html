ReviewText:It was in pretty rough shape. Carpet in the hallways was all bubbled up and the towel rack in bathroom was ripped off the wall and setting on the back of the toilet seat.

ReviewText:The hotel location is pretty convenient. You can eat and shopping in walk distance. There are free hotel shuttle bus to airport 24 hours. The room is clean and quiet. It's a wonderful choice!

ReviewText:I did NOT feel Safe in my room the back door towards the south entry was unlocked and the rooms do Not have a safety bar as with the better hotels like theMarriott or Hilton. I would feel much better if there were a safety chain or a metal bar lock on the inside of the door. Women and Children should feel safe in the rooms.

ReviewText:We had a rental car and had to paid $8/night. The parking was inconvenient. You had to walk up a flight of stairs (the upper lot was full) and then walk along a side walk to get to the hotel. There was no breakfast or even coffee in the room. Really - no coffee in the room. Fine make you pay for a breakfast, but I think mini coffee pots with one serving isn't too much to ask. It seems as if all the pricey hotels can't offer what all of the reasonably rate hotels do. Just said. I was amazed they didn't charge for wifi. We used it to be close to the airport - next time we'll stay out further, get a better deal with coffee and just get a bit earlier to get to the airport.
