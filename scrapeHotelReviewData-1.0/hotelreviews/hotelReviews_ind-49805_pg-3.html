ReviewText:Very good experience, hotel staff is very cordial and helpful to provide us with what we need. We arrived earlier than check in time and was provided with room to change for the wedding we need to attend. Upon our return, our luggage were put into the room with complimentary cheese platter. Hotel is beautiful, all in all beautiful experience at this boutique hotel.

ReviewText:I was looking for affordable hotels to stay in, downtown l.a., close to the action but not over, say, $150/night. I started out checking out the comfort inns, and other budget friendly types. however, i clicked on this hotel despite seeing the "Hilton" in front of the name and automatically knowing i wouldn't be able to afford it. Turns out, it was right around 150/a night, and fairly close to or just slightly more than the price of the budget friendly ones (i.e., comfort inn) PLUS on average, it was closer to all the action in downtown in l.a. the only negative i had, is that i called on the morning of my arrival, to confirm my check in and all that, and found out that they do a $100/night hold on a credit or debit card for incidentals. and while that wasn't a problem, it would have been nice to have been told that up front - say, on the confirmation email from [...], or something - maybe that is standard policy? but i didn't know, and would have preferred to have found out before me calling and asking about any and all possible other charges. However, they do return it within 2 - 4 days, pending there were no incidents. Other than that minor lack of communication though, i was pleasantly surprised about everything else. the hotel was classy, but intimate. Nice, upscale, but not over the top. the room was slightly smaller than i might have pictured, but it was comfortable and worked. if you want/need a refrigerator, its upon request - but no other extra charge. we even misplaced one of the  key cards, and i just knew it was about to be a crazy charge for that, but there wasn't. one of the bars/lounges we had planned to check out, The Standard, which I had been hearing about, was RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. The Santee Alley was a close walking distance. There was a rite aid and walgreens right around the corner. it was a central to practically everything. the weekend we stayed, there even was a soapbox derby going on that we got front row seats to (via our view from our room) to! all in all, it was very pleasant. Oh and the front desk staff and bellmen were all EXTREMELY hospitable!

ReviewText:I have been in Hilton hotels many times in different countries and always was fully satisfied. The location of Hilton checkers in LA is great - next corner to Millennium Biltmore Hotel, 2 blacks from Subway, 3 blacks from Music center and Civil center, few blocks from LA Convention Center. Front desk staff very friendly and helpful. Service was very good. The hotel areas were all very clean and smelling of flowers. My room next to elevator was nice and quiet. The spa and pool on top floor were great. The breakfast was not included but you can get it in the bet for $12 - European style and $19 - for American style. The dinner in Hotel Restaurant was good and not expensive. [...]. I really   enjoyed my trip in LA.

ReviewText:Very comfortable hotel. Luxurious. No free breakfast, I've been spoiled by the Hampton Inns. Expensive valet parking. Cheaper parking if you park yourself at nearby lots. Upscale hotel.

ReviewText:I went to LA to see my family on vacation. So we planned to stay at Hilton Checkers intially for four days. But after that we changed our plans because we didnt want to leave LA and we stayed at the same hotel for whole 15 days. This shows that the hotel was perfect. Amazing staff, amazing house keeping and wonderful location. The only problem is the parking that is like $40 a day which is outrageous. But you can park in Perish Square(A block away) for $15.95 a day which is not bad considering you are living in downtown LA. I would highly recommend this hotel to other people going to LA. [...] All in all, very good hotel.

ReviewText:The trip was excelent! Great location of the hotel, great flights, great service and all for a great price!! We were extremely impressed with the hotels service! They were sooo nice to the two of us with any questions we had! The next time we are in L.A we will def. Be staying at the hilton again!!  The rooms were clean( the size of the room was very small) but clean and perfect for the two of us. The ONLY bad part of the hotel was that the hot tub was broken, and was never fixed in the five days we were there.

ReviewText:My girlfriend and I were on a leisurely vacation in LA and loved the Hilton Checkers.  The location was perfect for great bars and restaurants.  The hotel staff was helpful, friendly and more than accommodating.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and plan on returning again in the near future.

ReviewText:The room was really great! Fresh towels and clean beds everytime we came back to our rooms. However, the front desk was horrible at times. They said they would do something but it never was done. Then we had to ring again and they hadnt done it.. It was an hour later!!! This happened on a number of occasions. Maybe next time live more closer to hollywood cause downtown LA was a Dead town. More to see outside of it!
