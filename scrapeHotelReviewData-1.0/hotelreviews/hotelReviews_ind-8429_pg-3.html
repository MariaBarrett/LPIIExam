ReviewText:it doesn't look like much from outside, however it's very beautifully designed inside. Very hip, chic and clean. Staff was very polite. Although it's in a beautiful and quite residential area, it's walking distance to alot of attractions.

ReviewText:Great hotel located next to Beverly Hills. Large and cozy rooms and hip vibes. Not the hottest place drawing big crowds but really well located.

ReviewText:As the scale of the facility is not big, you can get quick services for valet, checking in/out, etc.

ReviewText:I have stayed at the Le Montrose suites hotel in West Hollywood on several occasions and I quite frankly will not stay anywhere else while in Los Angeles. The location is perfect and the rooms are spectacular. The rooftop pool and view are the best in West Hollywood.

ReviewText:The rooms are very dated and is not what I expected from a 4 star hotel. The rooms were dusty and there was plastic wrap on all the glasses. The coffee maker was not useable:( Thank goodness my stay was short b/c I didnt feel comfortable here at all! The only great thing was the location of the hotel. It was close to the main strip.

ReviewText:Spent a long weekend with the girls at Le Montrose and loved every minute of it. The staff was so friendly and accomodating, even to our daily calls for more coffee packets. There is so much to do in Hollywood, we needed all the caffeine we could get! The walking path they recommended was outstanding, and make sure to hike the hollywood hills in Griffith Park, what a view! I would definitely return

ReviewText:I stayed at this hotel during a recent girls weekend in Los Angeles.  The location was perfect for us...close to Beverly Hills shopping and the Sunset Strip.  The hotel sits in a lovely residential neighborhood between Santa Monica Blvd and Sunset Blvd.  It is nice and quiet and perfect for morning walks.  There is a neighborhood cafe that we walked to for morning coffee.The staff was extremely helpful with any request.  They even brought us cookies one day!  Four of us stayed in an executive suite and there was plenty of room.  There is a great dressing area where we could all get ready at the same time without tripping over each other.  My only complaint with the room is that it did not have central air conditioning. Only a wall unit which cooled the room fine it just didn't extend into the dressing area so it tended to get really hot with hair dryers, etc. Room has a small kitchen area with a coffee pot and coffee was replenished everyday.  If we ran out we called the front desk and more was supplied right away. -newline- I would definitely recommend this hotel!

ReviewText:I was in LA on business and have stayed in this hotel in the past.  LOVE the location; LOVE the staff: LOVE the little restaurant AND excellent food. The roof deck is just great.  The hotel is also very clean.  The only downside is that the hotel is in need of a freshening up.  It is looking tired and worn. I would recommend the hotel as long as the person is accepting of worn around the edges.

ReviewText:Location is in a fairly quiet area but still very close to some great attractions.  Very roomy, but a little disappointed that the kitchens had no supplies and there were hardly any available when asked for.  Appearance is older than what pictures depict.
