ReviewText:Place is clean and good enough for a place to sleep over. The Dennis restaurant just within the premises was a plus. The ground floor location was not that great since you can hear people running on the top. A bit noisy also from cars off the street.

ReviewText:Great stay at a great location. Close to the 101 and the 405 and near Ventura Blvd. where you can eat, shop and play. The staff was great and our beds were extremely comfortable. We also had four different pillows from which to choose - felt like Goldilocks. There are golf courses nearby (within 3-5 miles) and easy driving to Universal too. We will stay at this hotel again.

ReviewText:I stay in L.A. around this time of year to visit my son during spring break. That being said the hotel is just a place to bed down,the room was very clean your typical amenities, could of used better blanket on the bed though.Staff was friendly. The hotel is right near the 405/burbank exit so traffic can be tough @ times. You are close to just about everything the parking lot gets full as there is a Dennys in the lot and can be noisy @ times.Used the pool only once. It was a little smaller but nice and secluded. Overall it was a decent Hotel would stay again

ReviewText:The hotel was easy to find and in the middle of everything. It was a short drive to Hollywood, Santa Monica and City Walk. The rooms were nice and spacious and the beds were so comfortable. We plan on staying here on our next trip!

ReviewText:I had a first floor room which was great. Always had a parking spot in front of my room. The room was a decent size however the shower and toilet felt a bit small. I was no impressed with the showers water flow and it took about 3-4 minutes for the warm /hot water to come on. The door is a sliding door and it gets stuck, will be awkward if you are traveling with someone else. -newline- The room was made up nicely every day with towels ready. The bed was comfortable and so were the pillows. Other readers complained about the noise but it did not bother me at all. -newline- There are several of places to get a snack in walking distance and a target near by. The 405 is a turn away and you are minutes away from Downtown L.A, Universal Studios which works out great. -newline- I only went to the pool area one day but did not go in the water due to winds but I was relaxing on a lounge chair. -newline- I did not need them much but the people at the front desk were friendly as the check in and out process went smoothly. -newline- I would return to the hotel again.
