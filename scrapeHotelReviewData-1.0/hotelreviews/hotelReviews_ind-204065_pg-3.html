ReviewText:The hotel is beautifully renovated, but not always functional and staff needs to iron out the details: -newline- 1. A/C noisy (despite letting the front desk know they did not follow up, nor fixed the thermostat so the fan could be adjusted). Annoying! -newline- 2. Breakfast: great for people with sweet tooths, but croissants, pastries and cakes are not very healthy. All served in plastic cups and plates. Extremely snobbish or wannabe cool, but a new hotel ought to attempt to reduce emissions. Also nowhere to hang wet towels. No options to retain these and reuse. Not cool. -newline- 3. We ordered takeaway and when I went to the lobby to ask if I they could take care of the garbage the concierge explained there was a dumpster around the block I could go to. Nuff said. -newline- 4. When the glass lamp in the bathroom fell out of the socket and exploded the guys fixing it did a great job, but despite being glass everywhere the front desk did not offer any dcompensation. We travelled with an infant who was actually on her way crawling into the bathroom. No injuries, but scary. Again: too cool for skool. -newline-  -newline- Time to get sharpen up The Line!

ReviewText:The Line was the perfect place to get away. It made for the perfect home base while I explored the sunny city. I only omitted a star because it's still a work in progress, but I can't wait to see it when it is done.

ReviewText:This site said they have a pool, spa, room service and other things But they do not have these things. If you want to visit there, take your time and call or email them to check they're ready. Service was great but I wish I could more enjoy at hotel. And also valet parking is must. You cant do free parking. -newline- Im disappointed at site's explanation of this hotel. Hotel will be ready before may(they said) -newline-  -newline- Anyway, After few months, this hotel will be great. I liked modern interior room style and super nice service too.

ReviewText:Hotel was great...We thought it opened the month prior and was surprised to realize it had only been opened a couple of days when we checked in. Once they have the restaurant and/bar open and or added...it will be great. Conveniently located across from the Tap ...subway.

ReviewText:Excellent front desk staff including everyone we spoke with, however we were some of the first guests and there were a number of problems which were to be expected. Most problems were resolved within a reasonable time. One big problem was Housekeeping which should not be a problem even on start up. I have had better service at a $80/night motel. I suggest waiting until the summer before visiting this hotel.

ReviewText:Great location and very neat hotel. Quite modern in design so don't expect a traditional hotel if you stay, but we really liked it. Rooms certainly not huge but we had an awesome view.
