ReviewText:good experience but i arrived about 30-45 min early and did not like that i had to wait until 3 to check in and had to wait outside in the heat. its not like other places where they check you in before time. even wouldnt let me in 15 min before my check in time. the rest of the trip was good, room service was friendy.

ReviewText:Our hotel room was very clean upon arrival and the housekeeping staff did an excellent job each day to keep the room clean and fresh. -newline-  -newline- The pool area was dissapointing and not very clean, all of the lights in the pool we're not working there was a lot of debris around the jacuzzi area.

ReviewText:The hotel is a mid rise building and is located conveniently close to colleges that I came to visit with my son, namely UCLA, USC, and LMU, as well as Santa Monica.  The common areas such as the lobby, pool, and corridors were clean and spacious and gave a feeling of luxury.  The rooms were clean and comfortable with nice bathrooms.  Only negative was that the toilet ran and made noise during the night.  Had breakfast at the hotel diner and it was pricey.

ReviewText:OVERALL, IT WAS A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE.  I LOVE HOW THEY KEPT THE HOTEL CLEAN AND THE STAFF WAS GREAT.  THERE WASN'T ANY KAOS AND IT WAS RATHER PEACEFUL.  THE ROOM I GOT HAD A MARVELOUS VIEW.  YOU COULD SEE OVER THE CITY AND IT JUST LOOKED BEAUTIFUL WHETHER IT'S DAY OR NIGHT.

ReviewText:The hotel is pretty close to airport, very efficient check-in and check-out processing, good for those busy travllers to stay, but the traffic not so convinient for you to travel in downtown.   The room is okey but bathroom is quite narrow, the carpet need to be cleaned.

ReviewText:This hotel is located at a very convenient place right near the high way and a relatively safe neighborhood. Room is large and quiet, and the bed is very comfortable. One thing that disappointed me is that they don't have tooth brushes at all! Maybe this is only a coincidence the day I checked in, anyway, FYI.

ReviewText:Radisson at Culver City is a very nice hotel for the price.  The room was large, nicely decorated, luxury bedding including a self adjusting mattress.  A short distance from the airport, shuttle is available from airport to hotel.  Conceirge was very helpful with arranging a tour and getting us transportation.  Location was close to shopping/dining, felt safe in this area of LA.  Customer Service of staff was excellent.  Allowed our group to check into our rooms early so we could enjoy the entire day in LA.  Would return to this hotel if traveling to LA.
