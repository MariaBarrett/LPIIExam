ReviewText:This hotel was pretty cool. Just don't be caught with an empty stomach scavenging for a quick bite before you go out on a Saturday night because every nearby restaurant is either a) closed; or b) a Korean BBQ that is undoubtedly delicious but has a 2 hour wait. -newline-  -newline- -- Awesome views -newline- -- left behind a hair curling iron and the staff insisted they could no longer access the room when we contacted lost and found because of a " new security" system. Awful way to end an otherwise terrific trip.

ReviewText:Staying at this hotel was a delight. For our first stay in LA, my girlfriend and I felt very welcome at The Line. -newline-  -newline- It was in a great location in Koreatown opposite the metro and very close to bus stops. -newline-  -newline- We stayed in one of the Hollywood Hills rooms and the view was breathtaking. We could see the Hollywood sign and beautiful landscape right from our very comfy bed. The trendy furniture and spacious bathroom were very clean. -newline-  -newline- Overall it was a great experience and the staff were very friendly. I look forward to staying there again.

ReviewText:While staying at the hotel, one can tell it has just opened. -newline-  -newline- The room was very nice, but parts of the room were not finished... screws were just sitting out on the floor near some unfinished window trim, the phone was placed on the floor, the bathroom had a lot of drywall dust and some of the power outlets didn't work. -newline-  -newline- When we got home, I noticed that the hotel had charged us *again* - even though we had pre-paid for the reservation. I've already spoken to two different people at the hotel about refunding, but am still waiting while they "investigate" the matter.

ReviewText:Hotel staff, all inclusive, was extraordinary! I was surprised when I pulled into our accommodations that I was met with valet parking attendants who informed me that parking was $32/night. Not that that is not to be expected, but it would be good if that is included in hotel description. I would have appreciated knowing that. Because of a glitch in our wi-fi connection, without my suggesting it, a manager waived my parking fees. The room was different in its decor, but extremely comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone coming to LA.

ReviewText:Stayed at the Line during it's "soft open", staff friendly and helpful. Location in Koreatown is well situated for commuting just about anywhere in L.A.... some amenities not available yet, like a pool or the restaurant. Rooms were very nice, clean with spectacular view of the Hollywood Hills. Only two disappointments, one a not-big-deal water temp in the shower, a bigger deal is pretty awful Wi-Fi service. Would stay again.

ReviewText:As you walk down the hall to your room, you're struck by the Concrete walls and the really cool looking carpet, and I was wondering, "Is it finished yet?"...(I mean I knew that they had been doing a multimillion dollar renovation), but then the friendly bell hop opened the door to the room, and there...at your feet...Los Angeles...WOW! If you have a chance get a room on the Hollywood sign side. -newline- The continental breakfast was very good, and soon the restaurant with Chef Roy Choi will be open. Overall a great experience!

ReviewText:Overall we had a great time, and staying here is a wonderful way to explore K-town. I even took the metro up to Hollywood. Would give this place an A for effort, but we were disappointed that it's still a work-in-progress. Roy Choi's restaurant POT has not opened yet, and the pool is still under construction. I can see where things are going, and wouldn't mind returning when it's all done, but it was billed as a January opening and there's clearly a lot of work still to do. That said, the staff was very responsive, you can take bikes out for four-hour rides free-of-charge, and the morning comped b.f. was very good.
