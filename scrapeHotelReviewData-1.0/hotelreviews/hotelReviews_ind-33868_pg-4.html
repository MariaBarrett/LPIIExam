ReviewText:We love this hotel.  This location is ideal. The dining was fantastic. We have stayed here several times and enjoy the fabulous outdoor dining with friends and business colleagues. The staff was great! The only improvement would be for the hotel shopping store, Accents. Except for the store manager, [...] at the Accents store!  Terrible service there. We will never shop at this hotel store again because of [...]. She was unprofessional and rude! Otherwise, we will continue to hold our business meetings and social gatherings at this hotel. Everyone else was wonderful! Thank you.

ReviewText:It's a great location, the rooms are super clean and comfortable and have great black out draperies.  Bathrooms are nice.  It's not the Beverly Hills Hotel, but for the price, the Beverly Hilton can't be beat

ReviewText:We thought that the rooms would be more spacious and elegent, by the number of stars it got. However, the rooms were very blase, if not sub-par. The staff was great, and the pool was great.
