ReviewText:Booked poolside cabana for day after oscars. Got VIP access to tearing down scafolding, clanging metal and cleaning up after large mess. Wish hotels would warn of such "inconveniences" at time of reservation and booking. Also, large decorative light bulbs throughout room make loud buzzing noises.

ReviewText:This is a hotel for people looking for a party place. The pool area is very nice and super busy with afternoon and evening parties. During my stay around Labour Day it was mostly a younger crowd, low 20s. If you like it, that's your place. Staff stood out as extremely courteous and helpful. From the valet drivers to concierge, they were always helpful.
