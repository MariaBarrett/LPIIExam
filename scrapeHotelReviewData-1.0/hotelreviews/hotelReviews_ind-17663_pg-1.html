ReviewText:Hotel was clean and the staff was very helpful! -newline- I was a bit concerned with the area of LA I was in. I didnt feel particularly safe. I would not stay here if I was alone.

ReviewText:Booked this room last minute. It was near Universal Studios which is why we chose it. The location was great. The room was clean and the staff friendly. Wish I had a chance to enjoy the pool. Bed was surprisingly comfortable.

ReviewText:The overall experience was amazing. We stayed at this hotel for a week and the rooms were always cleaned when we arrived back at the hotel after long days of viewing the city. The pool was great and we were in there at least once a night. However I did notice they could have cleaned the pool more often. Probably was cleaned every 2-3 days by the looked of it. There were just flower and plants in the pool. Hotel is right beside a Denny's which I found convenient and the food and service there is fantastic. The only experience I had that I was unsatisfied was when a high school group came to stay at the hotel and they weren't well behaved. We had a group of kids yelling and screaming right in front of our door. We had to ask them to be quiet and they still didn't listen. They were also running all over the place at 7am and when they were in the pool they were just as loud and inconsiderate of those around them. Nonetheless they were only there for a night or two and I was still able to enjoy my trip. I would book here again despite all that

ReviewText:Romm and staff were Very Good, but parking is the worst. 3 times coming back after midnight, I've had to park off site: once around 1/4 mile away. -newline-  -newline- Tired to get the hotel to have 1 assigned parking spot per room, but was always ignored. -newline-  -newline- Stay here, unless you got out at night.

ReviewText:I have stayed in the King suites previously, so this review is only regarding the two-bed tower suites: -newline-  -newline- Noise level is slightly higher on the 3rd floor of the tower, parking near the tower rooms is not usually enough if all the rooms are booked, you'll find yourself parked across the property or on the street if you come back to your room late enough. The elevators are a little scary. One of them's door doesn't close all the way immediately (it will eventually when the elevator starts moving) but they are relatively fast at least. -newline-  -newline- Rooms are much the same as the King bed rooms in the main courtyard, they seem slightly smaller, but that may just be because there are two beds in the room instead of one. Bathroom is adequate, but not luxurious. -newline-  -newline- Best feature is that you are close to the Jacuzzi. -newline-  -newline- I will likely stay here again, but I'll probably not stay in the tower again unless something goes wrong with my booking.

ReviewText:Perfectly situated for our needs. Room was comfortable, but the bathroom area was a bit tight for two people.

ReviewText:First room we stayed in had this horrible knocking coming from the inside of the wall. I spent almost an hour trying to figure out what it was but couldn't. This knocking went on and on through out the first night. On top of that, the pocket door to the bath room was off the track and did not close all the way. Leaving a open 4in gap (Peek-a-boo). Luckily the staff was nice enough to move us to another room that was much better. -newline-  -newline- Pros: Close to Freeways, $10 off at Denny's, Bed is pretty comfortable, up to date electronics, A/C works very good, water pressure is very high, free wi-fi, wall safe. -newline-  -newline- Cons: Parking is horrible, A lot of street/traffic noise, outside needs a lot of TLC, Not worth the price, more like a motel than a hotel, walls are kind of thin. -newline-  -newline- Conclusion: if you need a place to sleep just for the night, then this place is ok. But any longer then I would rather shell out an extra $60 and at a nicer hotel or something a little less risque.
