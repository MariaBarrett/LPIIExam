ReviewText:I looked at this hotel reviews in web and found this hotel ot be in the perfect spot, so I wented ahead and booked it. Since I did not drive in LA the location of this Hotel was right next to the Hollywood Highland Metrolink station which made my travel within LA very convenient. I would recommand this Hotel if they are willing to stay connected to Unverisal studio.

ReviewText:Hotel was great , just wished they had an in door pool, I wasn't able to enjoy the pool because it was too cold, also, there was no Jacuzzi. I also, wish the fiat service drop off as well pick up that would top the hotel service off. Overall all everything else was great.

ReviewText:Fast check-in, free room upgrade, exceptionally friendly and helpful staff. Location was perfect. We only ate in the restaurant for breakfast - the food was delicious, although I wouldn't recommend the buffet as it is really overpriced for was they offer. The menu was very reasonably priced though with huge portions. The Lobby Bar might be my new happy place. If they could do something about LA traffic, we would return again and again!

ReviewText:Great location, clean and comfortable room. Only down side was only one mirror in our room and room service stopped at midnight. Other than that is was a great hotel with ideal Hollywood blvd location.

ReviewText:It is a mess around the hotel with construction.... I only mentioned how it was pretty difficult to park and then find the entrance to the hotel and they upgraded my room to a brand new luxury room on the 19th floor for free!
