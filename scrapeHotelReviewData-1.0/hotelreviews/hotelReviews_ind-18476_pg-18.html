ReviewText:I've stayed at the Hacienda before but only in the newer wing....this time I ended up in the West tower which was probably last updated during the Roosevelt administration. Overnight parking was an additional $8 and wasnt' convenient at all. -newline-  -newline- Location can't be beat the restaurant next door is very good. Airport shuttle was frequent so that's probably the good news about the Hacienda.

ReviewText:For the money, this was a great place to stay near LAX. We used their airport shuttle service twice. The shuttle was on time, with courteous and helpful drivers. Our room, in the 5th floor tower, was comfortable and quiet......nothing fancy, but served our purpose well. We would recommend this hotel when you need accommodations close to LAX.

ReviewText:The hotel is located in a central convenient location, nicely close proximity to the LAX airport. The hotel is clean but old. The size of the double-beds room is okay , but the bath room is very tiny small, and the bath vanity is very small. The ice bucket was put right above and very close to the toilet. Just when I was in a shower already, then found that there was no hair conditioner provided for the room. The room was provided with only 1 face towel, 1 hand towel and 2 bath towels, should be more. The room was smelling moldy. I had to open the window a little bit to get the air circulated. Now I know why other travel company grades it 2 stars only. I think it should be 2 stars.

ReviewText:Staff could not find our prepaid reservation. Told us to wait - then disappeared into a back room - and then reappeared to wait on other customers. We had to again wait - staff not interested in locating our reservation. After a long delay, we did get rooms -- only to find they were dark, dreary, and very run down. The ceiling registers were extremely dirty - with dust hanging down. No amenities at all. No coffee in room or available in the lobby. A parking fee for parking lot a block from hotel. This is definitely NOT a 3 Star Hotel ! Our recommendations - find some other place to stay.

ReviewText:I admit i chose this hotel based on location and price. Well, i got what I paid for, there is no doubt about that. -newline-  -newline- Staff: Rude and obnoxious. There was a prom being held on the night of our stay and i was told that there was no parking and I would have to "hunt" for it on the street. When I asked if she was kidding me, she didn't seem to have any empathy. No concern for the customer who booked the room, no concern for the 12 hour travel day. Nothing. Rude. They were glad to charge me for it, just in case I found parking but if I didn't find any, they'd remove it for me. -newline-  -newline- Hotel/Room: Stinks. There is a foul smell in the South Tower. I know the hotel is old, there could be some quaintness to it. Instead, it smells and is not clean. The bathroom had mold in the shower. I was disgusted and it made the the rudeness of the clerk add insult to injury. -newline-  -newline- The only positive I can think of: The wifi was free. -newline-  -newline- I will not book this hotel ever again and I don't recommend you do either.

ReviewText:The hallways have a disgusting odor... like something they need to change the carpet or allow fresh air to come in. The bathroom was small, and all the appliances in their were old. the parking sucks you have to pay, its not on site and you have to use your hotel card each time you want to leave and enter the parking lot. Would not stay here ever again.

ReviewText:Room was clean and quiet. Only problem was the tv didn't have very good reception. Staff friendly and helpful. It does take a bit time to check in...they need more staff at desk. Shuttle service very good...nice kind driver. Good location...plenty of places to eat. I have stayed there before and will again when I am back in the USA.

ReviewText:The hotel location is great. The lobby is also very nice. I enjoyed the views and the aesthetics. There are also nearby restaurants for convenience. The room was small, but clean. One issue I had is that the hotel only provided one set of towels even though the room was a double occupancy. I called the front desk for more towels, but housekeeping never showed. I even left a note in the bathroom, but to no avail. That is a first for me. Guest should also know that parking is eight dollars per day as of May 2013.

ReviewText:Room was very small and the shower stunk a little from the drain and the water pressure barely trickled out.

ReviewText:The only problem was they put a hold on your card $50 a night. That wasn't cool becausethat money could've been spent on things there in California, other then that it was a awesome hotel with a bar & music. Fire place outside so you can drink and smoke cigs, if your into that. Staff was nice, location perfect.
