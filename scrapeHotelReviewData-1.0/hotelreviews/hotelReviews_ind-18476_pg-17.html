ReviewText:Good stay. Centrally located near food, mall and airport. A microwave an/ or a refrigerator could have improved stay. Plan to stay again in future.

ReviewText:The architecture and decor suggest a nicer hotel than we actually got; the place is clearly old, but fine, and it has clearly been cleaned up well after seeing worse days. The room was fine, a little dingy but clean enough, and the location by the airport was spectacular for the price in L.A. -newline-  -newline- Really craved complimentary coffee, but there wasn't any in the room or the lobby. -newline-  -newline- However, the kindest courtesy of all was extended to us via a sign posted in the parking lot: "Vehicles with an alarm sounding for more than 5 minutes will immediately towed and impounded, no exceptions."

ReviewText:Great location because of it's proximity to LAX. But the hotel is VERY old and certainly not as nice as the pictures portray. Smokers congregate at the back door near the pool area, and the smoke fills the hallway. Certainly not fun to walk into as you step off the elevators. Carpets need replacing and the room smelled VERY musty. BUT, the bed was VERY comfortable and we got GREAT sleep for the night. Some of the shuttle drivers are VERY rude and short. Front desk staff were friendly.

ReviewText:It had average accommodations and is within a couple miles from the airport, and close to restaurants and a grocery store. The location was perfect for what we needed. Their parking lot is wanting. The spots are very narrow. The night we stayed the hotel was booked and there wasn't any parking left. So they don't have enough spots to accommodate all their guests, and they charge for parking.

ReviewText:My First visit was Great, The staff at the Hotel was very helpful and got my needs taking care of Great job,, But my Second visit was not a Great Experience and I'll till you why, When I Arrived to the Hotel to check in at the front Desk they thought that I had Canceled my Reservation and why would I be taking a flight to Los Angeles to a Hotel that I'm not going to stay at!! So about 10 minutes later they had found out that I did had Reservation at this Hotel, I know check outis about -newline- noon but why Did the front Desk had someone else had the same room key if I have not check out yet? The front Desk was Informed that I was not going to check out until 2:00pm and that was Excitable by the Hotel staff, I Feel so uncomfortable that something like a mix-up can happen like this!!!
