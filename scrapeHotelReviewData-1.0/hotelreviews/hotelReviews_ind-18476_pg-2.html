ReviewText:Basic hotel. Fridge in room is a nice perk. Location is great - 5-10 minutes by shuttle to airport (depending on traffic). Not luxurious or with other frilly amenities but good for overnight stay

ReviewText:We arrived at the Hacienda near midnight and found others had discovered the Value of the Hacienda Hotel. Maybe 8 people in line before us but the line quickly dwindled. We found the room to be decorated somewhat underwhelming but very clean and comfortable. Sure wish there was a coffee pot in the room to jump start the day but their restaurant is only 50 steps away. -newline- All in all, it worked very well for a quick nights sleep before getting back on the plane.

ReviewText:Stayed here as a quick overnight after Coachella. The staff was extremely helpful even though I was checking in very very late. The rooms are clean and big but the beds are older and not all that great if you're a light sleeper.
