ReviewText:Right next to airport, but you would't want to try to walk to terminal.  Hotel shuttle only left once/hour in the peak AM travel. -newline- Easy to find off the 405, good parking, restaurant was fairly priced with OK food.  More interesting restaurants a block away. -newline- Very quiet for an airport location.  Great desk staff.

ReviewText:whether it was calling for a shuttle or arranging for a wake up call or requestig some basic information the front desk never seemed to want to pick up the phone. It may well be that the staff is not paid enough so they are not motivated to work or the other case may be a lack of traiig or multi-management

ReviewText:First, it is noisy.  Rooms come equipped with earplugs for a reason. -newline- Second, they charge $14 a night for parking, not disclosed, even tho none of the other hotels in the area do. -newline- Third, when my plans changed and I was out of my room for two days with a prepaid reservation for four nights, hotel staff stole the property I had left in my room, and re-rented my room, so that when I returned, I had no room!!  NO APOLOGY whatsoever.  No offer of a refund. NADA. -newline- Very unprofessional. -newline- Rooms are very clean.

ReviewText:The room was OK although the bathroom was very small and dirty.  As well, there were workman's materials clearly visible outside of our room window (we were on the ground floor) and there were no curtains - only sheers that we could close.

ReviewText:It is true that you don't hear airplanes because you are in Culver City and not under the main approaches but I would have welcomed airplanes overhead to the loud music rattling my windows coming from the pool area 4 floors below. -newline-  -newline- The shuttle driver and desk clerk were very nice. -newline-  -newline- The rooms were very dated, dingy and in desperate need of renevation. -newline-  -newline- The TV and furniture looked like they were 20 years old. -newline-  -newline- The bathroom was so small that the door cleared the front of the toilet by 6". -newline-  -newline- The famous sleep number beds gave us plenty of comic relief though. I laid down on my side and almost shot my wife off the other side of the bed. -newline-  -newline- Worst of all is that the cost was the same as the resorts at Palm Springs and Lake Arrowhead that we had just stayed at. -newline-  -newline- Needless to say, my wife has fired me from making future hotel reservations. -newline-  -newline- Kind of a depressing end to an otherwise awesome California vacation.

ReviewText:It's a nice hotel and rooms are well appointed. -newline- There were two family reunions and a wedding while I was there, but it didn't affect my stay.  The hotel is large and can easily handle the activities. -newline-  -newline- I was by the stairwell on my floor and it was very noisy at night.  That was a bummer, as I enjoyed everything else about the room and location.
