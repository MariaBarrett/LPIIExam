ReviewText:1)several days after making the reservation through Orbitz, the hotel still didn't have the reservation -- corrected via a very long phone call to Orbitz -newline- 2)upon arrival the hotel put us in a room without a cabana -- the reservation was for "garden view" cabana. Initially they insisted the room we were had a cabana -- eventually they did put us in a "garden view" which was actually a street view, cabana room which had no acess to the pool. -newline- 3) the room had only one robe for 2 guests -newline- 4) the room had no coffee pot -- housekeeping delivered upon request and had to be asked a second time to bring cups -newline- 5) there is no ice available on the first floor (even though they say ice is on every floor) except when the pool bar is open -newline- 6) when we asked about a late checkout, we were told on the phone that for an additional $150.00 we could stay until 10 pm; when we checked in we were told that the $150 would only buy a 4 pm checkout -newline- 7)the noise  from the room next door was quite loud all night and incuded loud music and an unbelievable number of banging doors, very unhappy with our stay.

ReviewText:Despite all the negative reviews I read online about the Roosevelt, I found it to be simply wonderful. We had a beautiful suite, received first-class service from check in to valet to poolside waitstaff and more. We did not eat at the hotel nor drink at any of the bars, mainly due to us having other obligations away from the hotel. We did want to get a night cap on Saturday evening but decided to do so in the our room. The pool bar and other lounges were full of 20 somethings sloppy drunk and obnoxious. I have to say the only two things really keeping my review from being 5 star is location, that part of Hollywood is VERY run down and way too touristy. The second being the non-guests of the hotel that come to use the pool and bars. Young pretentious people only wanting to see and be seen and with WAY more attitude than class.

ReviewText:This was my first stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt. We were very much looking forward to our stay.          Check-in went very amoothly and the lady at the front desk was very pleasant. We were then told that we had been upgraded to a cabana balcony room. These are rooms overlooking the swimming pool, and the view is indeed very nice. However, our room wss small and very dark. The furnishings are very stylish. There are no rugs or carpets on the hardwood floors, and apart from the bed there is really no place else to sit. Another drawback is the fact that these rooms are facing a poolside nightclub, and the music and noise level of the crowd keeps on until about 1:00 a.m. Again, the front desk didn't mention this when we checked in.          One more comment; I took our car out of valet the next day to go shopping, and tipped the valet attendant $5.00. I thought this was pretty reasonable, since he had driven our car about thirty feet from where it was parked. Oh well, I guess it is Hollywood, after all.           Before leaving, there were two charges to my room that I had to dispute. It seems thta someone ordered 2 beers from the poolside bar and charged them to my room (I don't drink). All in all, i would be reluctant to recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:We stayed at the Roosevelt and it was awesome.  The staff was extremely helpful.  My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and they upgraded us from the room that we were in to a Cabana room by the pool.  The room itself was small, but the had a great balcony and view of the pool.  On top of that, the location of this hotel could not have been better.  It is right in the middle of Hollywood with the Grauman's Chinese Theater half a block away.  My only complaint was that they offered spa services but did not have an actual spa, but charged premium prices.  Your options for a massage were to have a massage in your room, by the pool or in their massage room.  None of which were ideal.  If the massage was at the pool, there was no privacy.  If it was in the massage room, the room itself was semi-private with 3 massage tables and on the back side of the hotel and there was a lot of street noise on that side.  I didn't want a massage in my room because I felt like it wasn't fair to my husband to kick him out.  We ate at 24 degrees and the food was so good and the decor around the hotel was also very cool.  Overall, I would strongly recommend this place again, just don't expect to get a massage.
