ReviewText:I love this hotel and everything about it. When you check in, they are so professional and kind. The rooms are spotless the service is wonderful. The vallet parking is wonderful and quick and they are all so pleasant, they always make me smile when I stay there. I have stay at five star hotels and really high in resorts and I would pick this hotel again over the previous hotels I've stayed at. I was in town for work and did'nt get a chance to do much while I was there, however they made my stay amazing .... Thank you to the management and staff !!! I love The Beverly Hilton.. Yes I have already told everyone to stay here when they are in LA..

ReviewText:The beverly hilton is a beautiful hotel with history. There are constantly large events hosted at the hotel. We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again. The room was clean and very comfortable. The pool and pool area area are both very nice. The standard room are not very spacious but the huge bathroom and balcony made up for it. Parking is steep but this is standard for any hotel in the Beverly Hills area.

ReviewText:When we went to dinner at Trader Vic's in the hotel, we came back to find our keys didn't work. It took about 20 minutes for someone to come and open the door, and we were stuck in the freezing hallway waiting. -newline-  -newline- The room was also extremely small. I actually couldn't believe they fit a bathroom in there. And there was no DVD player. -newline-  -newline- That being said, when I asked for things to be delivered to the room -- robes, plates -- the service was very prompt.

ReviewText:Located centrally in Beverly Hills, this Hilton is a great deal. I wanted a room with outdoor space and they were able to accommodate me with a Pool Side room. It was perfect. The rooms are a good size and clean, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
