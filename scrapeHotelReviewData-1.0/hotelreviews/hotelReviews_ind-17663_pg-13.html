ReviewText:The hotel on the outside looked great, however, it was a pain to find parking. I think that they should make enough parking spots for the amount of tenants they have. If you get hungry, then i suggest not going to the Denny's that's connected to the hotel. The food was tasteless and not cooked all the way. However that was at about 2 in the morning so the morning cooks may be better. The hotel room itself is also very nice and the beds and pillows are extremely comfortable. Overall i had a lovely stay.

ReviewText:This motel was perfect for the price. We scored a re-modeled room and were totally impressed! Wished we could have stayed longer! Also loved the proximity to the restaurant...just steps away. Would highly recommend! It was a great location for all points of L.A.
