ReviewText:We stayed at this hotel the night before leaving LAX very early. It was a good enough hotel, comfy beds, clean and well presented. We liked the token cookie too. -newline- Perfect for a quick night stay before a flight. -newline- But beware: check if they have a shuttle to the airport as we had seen it advertised and then once there they said the service was no longer available.

ReviewText:I thought the hotel was wonderful... the only issue I would mention is the 'Parking Fee' of $15.00 per day. I am not disputing the fact that they are charging a fee necessarily, however, I think it should either be included in the overall hotel cost and if not done that way, that all potential guests be made aware of this added cost before they finalize their reservation. The people were extremely friendly...the room was nice...had everything one could need, other than a personal chef in the closet haha. I would recommend it highly. :)

ReviewText:We arrived at this hotel later in the day and the staff was very friendly, at check in. The room was very clean at first, then realized the outlets look like they had been broke and dirty. Then we proceeded to the hot tub. The hot tub was about 80 degree's tops, so when another guest came out about 10 minutes of us being in the hot tub, we proceeded to explain that it was cold, she went and told staff and the front and they said they would be right out to turn in up. 10 more minutes passed and they still weren't out there, my sister went it and confronted them and they said sorry, he (pool man) is on another call. After about a total of 45 minutes I went inside and asked, the only thing she could say was "we are sorry, he is still on another call." I went back out to the hot tub and then 15 minutes later still no one. I went inside and said "forget it" and all they would do is tell me they were sorry. Not very accommodating to our needs and expectations. Its a hot tub, not a pool. You have to pay for parking and the parking lot only had bus parking left when we got there, maybe a bigger parking lot if there are that many guests. Couldn't even park in a stall.

ReviewText:The Doubletree in Culver City had the friendliest staff, the most comfortable rooms/beds, and other awesome amenities! The staff exceeded my expectations and were the friendliest in LA! I will recommend the DoubleTree in Culver City to all my friends, and have already! The cleanliness of the rooms was better than I could have done myself

ReviewText:I have nothing but good things to say about DoubleTree by Hilton In Culver City, it was fantastic! We stayed there for 2 weeks over Christmas and New Years. Our room was very comfortable, and we had a beautiful view. The location was great, only minutes away from all of the tourist areas. The staff was very friendly, the food was amazing, and the outdoor pool was great, it felt like a hot bath.
