ReviewText:Some day our son will be a "star" in Hollywood? He has wanted to go to Hollywood since he was five. He is now fifteen and we finally made the trip staying at the Renaissance Hollywood hotel and spa. It was clean, smoke free and located right next to the Kodak and Chinese Theater. It's all about location,location,location! The down side was: 1) After spending 250.00 a night, we still had to pay for parking 2)In order to get a bottle of water for bed-time you had to walk out on the main strip or pay 6.25per bottle to get it from the hotel 3)In order for us to use my lap-top in the room I had to pay 12.95 a day. Please understand that I am a bit tight when it comes to my money.

ReviewText:Being at the heart of Hollywood, it was a convenient trip to all the different tourist attractictions, whether it was by taxi, bus, or subway. There was the plaza right behind our hotel and it was nice to have somewhere to go in the mornings, before anything else was open. The bus and train station were right downstairs which was nice. The hotel was so clean, and the staff was very friendly and professional. Definitely one of the best hotels for a short trip to LA

ReviewText:Rainy weekend in Hollywood. Didn't get to go out and do the sightseeing we had planned due to the wet weather, but we enjoyed the hotel amenities. Took a taxi to see a concert nearby at The Music Box on Saturday night which was lots of fun and convenient. Would stay again, hopefully with better weather next time.

ReviewText:You could not ask for a better hotel location to take in Hollywood. The room was clean, the beds very comfortable, the food was excellent, the staff was friendly and attentive and you stepped right out onto the walk of fame. There were so many choices of restaurants, shopping venues, and nightlife making this hotel well worth visiting again and again.

ReviewText:Great location that allowed us to walk to many nearby attractions and restaurants.  Connecting mall/plaza was a bonus.  Parking garage was easy to get in and out of for being in the heart of the city once we gained familiarity.  Easy drive to Universal Studios and Beaches.  Staff was friendly and helpful and the kids enjoyed the late pool hours.  Would definitely return.  Great overall value!

ReviewText:Staff is very friendly and this was our 3rd time at the hotel. There are 2 size rooms and this time we got the small size.  Think of Marriott Courtyard.  The room and bath were almost dead ringers for Courtyard but the Courtyard bedding is better.  Plenty of cable TV channels and a very quiet hotel given the Hollywood/Highland location. We will be back!

ReviewText:We were in town for the Jerry Bruckheimer Celebration/Prince of Persia premier, and decided to get a room.  The staff let us check in early and we got a room with a view of the Hollywood sign.  Very clean, quiet, and comfortable.  We spent the day browsing the shops, Grauman's Chinese Theater, and the Kodak theater (all of which are right next to the hotel).  Ended the day with a Pirates movie at the El Capitan across the street.  Some of the stars were there to introduce the film.  It was so nice to just walk half a block to our room after an exhausting day.  Would definitely stay again.
