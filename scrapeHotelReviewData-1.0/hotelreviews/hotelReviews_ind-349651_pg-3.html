ReviewText:PROS -newline- This Hotel location is perfect. Right across the street from the Staples Center and 3 minutes from the Convention Center. Lots of food choices in the area with LA Live right across the street. Starbuck close by for those who need their fix in the morning.Free Wireless internet.Complimentary water bottles everyday. -newline- CONS -newline- Even from the top floors the noise from the street is heard very clearly. There is almost an event happening every night at the Staples Center so be prepared for noise well into the late hours.No microwave or fridge in rooms. -newline- Overall, if you don'y mind the noise, would stay at same location again. staff friendly and front desk accomadates requests -newline- quickly.

ReviewText:Room and location were excellent. Checkin staff were helpful. Breakfast was appalling. They took around 3/4 of an hour to serve us. Portions were small as was selection. Napkins had white fluff which meant that my pants were flecked white just before an important trade show. Definiitely room to improve here.

ReviewText:The Luxe was recently renovated in the last few years. Located directly across the street from L.A. Live and the Staples Center. Very accessible from Figueroa Street. You don't have to drive through the major downtown LA streets which can be frustrating. Mandatory valet parking for $25 per night. Very modern, clean and well-appointed. Nice touches in the room like robes, slippers, LCD tv, iPod dock. Cold bottled water upon check-in. We booked the same day and it was pricey-but it's downtown LA.

ReviewText:Excellent room, staff, location, value! Only complaint is we had to keep going out of the hotel to eat since the dining facility was under renovation. Went to CA to attend a conference at the Nokia Live Theater. Hotel was across the street. Couldn't have asked for a better hotel location. Was also able to schedule a half-day tour through the hotel and the folks came to the hotel to pick us up and take us to the tour bus location.

ReviewText:We recently visited the Luxe Hotel in the City Center for purposes of seeing a concert. This was our second stay as guest and we again, were not disappointed. The rooms have all been remodeled and updated and the location is fabulous for planned events at the City Center. As they say, it's all about location, location, location...and the Luxe Hotel is just the place to enjoy yourself.....Great time and can't wait to go back for some more fun and of course, we will be booking again at the Luxe Hotel. Highly recommended.

ReviewText:Staff was pleasant -newline- Room was nice and well appointed. -newline- Very close to downtown and Staples. -newline- I was told not to put anything in refrig or $50 added to bill. This is not good as most hotel have a refrig for just that. -newline- My wife got bit by a bed bug even though we had white sheets. Maybe just our bad luck. -newline- Would stay again for the convenience and value, but check the bed.
