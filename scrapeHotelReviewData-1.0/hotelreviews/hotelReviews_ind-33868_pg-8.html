ReviewText:The bedroom was beautifully decorated and we liked that there was an extra TV in the bathroom.  The bathroom and shower were particularly modern and lovely.  Don't eat breakfast in the hotel it was overpriced.  The dinner at Cirque 55 in the hotel was delicious and I recommend the restaurant.

ReviewText:The Beverly Hilton was one of the swankest hotels I have ever stayed in and was suprisingly not outrageously priced.  I am a 23 year old college student and was visiting UCLA for a job interview.  A free car took my to and from UCLA and the driver was very friendly and professional.  Sitting by the pool was very relaxing and the pool-side menu was delicious.  Make sure to stop by the hotel lobby bar.  The bartenders are some of the nicest people I have met in LA and were very easy to speak to.  I loved the decor of the hotel and the room I was staying in.  One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.
