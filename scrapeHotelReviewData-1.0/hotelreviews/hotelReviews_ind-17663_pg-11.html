ReviewText:This hotel was average. The room was bigger than I expected. I liked the large fridge in the room. I also liked the fact that they had a sink/mirror in the bathroom and one outside of the bathroom. This enabled me to get my makeup/do my hair on while someone was using the restroom. -newline- The hotel is adjacent to a Denny's. You will receive a 10% discount there when you show your room key.

ReviewText:We recently stayed at the Best Western Carriage Inn, and we were very happy with our stay. It was affordable, easy to reach (right off the highway), the pool was warm, and the room was in good condition.

ReviewText:The staff very kind and proffesional , well done guys. -newline- Amenities , can improve to a continental breakfast. -newline- Parking it gets crowder and hard if you get late to the hotel, the discount in the restaurant next door didnt happen to get food to go. -newline- Everything else was reasonable good. -newline- We will come back.

ReviewText:We slept well, the bathroom facilities were roomy, everything worked. The air-conditioner was set at a good level when we first unlocked the door, and made only a reasonable amount of noise. -newline-  -newline- The amenities that were lacking: the parking spaces were too small, the TV remote required an unusual amount of force to operate, and the vending machines had very limited supplies.
