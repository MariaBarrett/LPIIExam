ReviewText:We had a 16' truck with equipment that we had no place to park.  The surrounding lots would not accomodate us overnight.  The manager was very helpful in solving the problem.  My only complaints would be that the bed wasn't very comfortable and we couldn't find a late night snack when we returned to the hotel.  No pool but the jazz in the beer garden was great!

ReviewText:I was here distinctly to attend an art opening at the nearby Japanese-American National Museum. I don't have a car and here in LA I didn't want to be taking the train home late at night. After checking-in I spent a relaxing afternoon/evening in the gardens and enjoyed drinks and a small meal. Great selection of drinks and food and they had 'happy hour' pricing.  The room ws all I needed, a basic room with CATV, king bed, and the bathroom gad all the basic amenities you would need. The best feature of the room were windows that would partially open for fresh air, as opposed to the adjustable AC and they also has a series of sliding panels wich would allow sunlight through but obscure the view. You could slide them around to whatever degree of closure/openness desired. After I returned back that night I capped off the night at their Genji Bar, open till 1am. I liked the hotel and area a lot.The nezt day I had the American style breakfast at their Garden Grill. I explored the surrounding area on foot and had lunch at a nearby Japanese eatery. Back at the hotel I went back to the outdoor garden for a drink or two, they had a wedding that night so the gardens were basically closed to other guests. I hung out at their Rendezvous Bar (Lobby Bar) and met a bunch of other guests and about five of us had quite a long time together, including the weekend bartender, I think his name is Roberto and he makes the best Mojito you will ever have. I got some good suggestions for dinner and they proved to be good. The hotel has a few other nice looking restaurants with nice views but they are  bit pricey. While the hotel does not have a pool/hot tub, they do have an on-site spa whose prices weren't bad at all; various types of massage and sauna services. Overall a great experience close to all the downtown/little Tokyo area has to offer. CLose to the Metro station and free parking for those driving.

ReviewText:Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens is a comfortable, and clean choice.  The surrounding area, Little Tokyo, is safe and quiet.  The check in was hassle free.  The room was decent size, comfortable, and clean.  Clean towels, soap, shampoo, and conditioner were restocked everyday.  The wireless internet has a surcharge, so I just went to the Starbuck's up the street, and used their's.  The hotel also has a Starbuck's in the lobby, its a smaller, but suffice.  This hotel has a great centralized location for L.A., but you probably still need a car though.  If you're driving, you can pack your car in the lot across the street for $8 per 24 hours.  Personally, I parked at a meter, along the side of the hotel. I was out of the space before 8 every morning, so I didn't have to pay the meter.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend.

ReviewText:Kyoto Grand Hotel was very clean,had a great bar, and plenty of restaurants, but I would recommend it for a business trip or a quick stay. I was very satisfied with the rate, but felt like the youngest guest in the hotel. =)A pool would have topped it off. =)

ReviewText:My husband and I stayed here overnight to go to a Dodgers game. The hotel was close to the stadium and very comfortable. The room design was unique and I loved the angles of the room--very different from your typical square box. From what I could see, the bar was nice and there was a cute little art gallery as well. It was definitely not a luxury resort, but it was nice, clean, cute and had everything we needed. Also, our room overlooked a rooftop garden owned by the hotel that had walking paths and fountains. A wedding was taking place there so it was fun to watch.

ReviewText:We had a group of 6 guys staying at this hotel for a job going on close by.  The hotel was very nice, however there was not much of a resturaunts.  All there was to eat close by was sushi places.  Overall it was a very nice hotel for the price.  Would definitely stay again.
