ReviewText:The major problem was having a card key that did not work. We got in at 9pm. 9:40 before we were able to get into room. We missed dinner at hotel as 9:45 when we hit lobby and restaurant to close at 10:00pm. Bar lobby wait staff outstanding. Got some food. -newline- At checkout mentioned problem told charges for something to be removed. Have not seen credit.

ReviewText:Picked this hotel because we were attending the LA Artwalk. The location was perfect due the close proximity to the galleries. Maybe a 6-7 block walk. The hotel staff was amazing-very friendly and truly made us feel welcome. The breakfast buffet was delicious and the staff even remembered that I liked cheese on my scrambled eggs every morning! I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again in the future.

ReviewText:My son and I were in LA to attend the Pac 12 track and field championships at USC. We enjoyed the hotel and particularly appreciated its location in the civic center area. Right across the street from the beautiful art deco LA city hall and down the street from the LA Times building, another notable deco building. Also very close to the Metro Red/Purple rail line Civic Center station.

ReviewText:I've stayed at this hotel twice and since it's been remodeled its still great and comfortable! The staff is always helpful, easy check-in and out, a taxi is usually waiting outside or the front desk will call one for you! The rooms are comfortable, clean and modern with a view of downtown. It's near Little Tokyo and not too far from the airport. I was very pleased with my visit.
