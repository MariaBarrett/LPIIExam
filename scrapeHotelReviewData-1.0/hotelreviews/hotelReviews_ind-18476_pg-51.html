ReviewText:Very nice hotel for the price. We flew into LAX late and night and just wanted a basic hotel by the airport before driving out to our destination the next morning. -newline-  -newline- Everything was very clean. The lobby and hallways are nicely decorated. Nice breakfast at the restaurant. Really good water pressure in the shower. -newline-  -newline- The airport shuttle seemed to take a long time to arrive - definitely call the hotel when you arrive and they'll send it out. -newline-  -newline- I was worried about the bed. The mattress needs to be replaced - I like firm mattresses, but this one was like a rock and it bounced every time my husband or I moved. I slept well enough though. The towels were small and thin and only two were provided. I could have used both myself. -newline-  -newline- The Hacienda would be my first choice if I needed to stay right by the airport at LAX again. Good price for the level of cleanliness and I like that it has some character over the chains.

ReviewText:Overall is OK. The restaurant is not that good, greasy, charred, bitter or tasteless stuff. -newline-  -newline- The wall is so thin you can hear everything in the room next to you and the jet roaring from LAX is really annoying. -newline-  -newline- But the staffs are friendly ant attentive, good service mind, the location is good. -newline-  -newline- If I can grab it at around $65/night, it will be great, just a little expensive for this quality.

ReviewText:MY HUSBAND JUST GOT OF OF THE HOSPITAL AND WE HAD TO WALK FOREVER TO GET TO OUR ROOM IF WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO GET A PARKING SPACE. THEY SHOULD HAVE SPECIAL PARKING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT FLYING OUT ANYWHERE.THE ROOMS ARE OLD AND SMELLING THEY NEED TO UPDATE,THE CEILING IN OUR ROOM LOOKED LIKE IT WAS GOING TO FALL IN. THE BEDS ARE HORRIBLE.

ReviewText:The Hacienda is a very pretty & restful place to stay. We wanted a place near the airport because we had early morning return flights. Hacienda fit the bill perfectly and it also had shuttles running regularly. The rooms were spotlessly clean and odor-free & the bathrooms were clean, pleasant and everything worked as it should. The staff were friendly and helpful. We didn't get a chance to try their restaurants but they had about 3 in-house restaurants. Location-wise, the area was good, it had a fair amount of eateries and fast-food places right across the street and a Walgreen's right next to the hotel. It is about 20-30 mins from any of the touristy places but with a car its not a problem. There is enough space for parking and they charge a nominal parking fee per day. The hotel provides very good value for the money. It provides the same service as its much pricier counterparts. It was our first visit to LA and I would definitely stay there the next time I visit it.
