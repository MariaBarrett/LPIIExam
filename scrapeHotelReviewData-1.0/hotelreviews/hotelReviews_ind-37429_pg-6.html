ReviewText:It's a nice, clean hotel. The location is very confortable, across the street you have the Conrads restaurant with great service 24 hs, with half a price of the hotel restaurant. Parking is extra 18 dollars a day and you have no other option near. You have only free wifi at the lobby and at the rooms is very expensive. The neiborhood is very quiet and safe, banks and offices only, you have some Sturbucks, gas stations and a lot of nice restaurants a few blocks from there. You also have Glendale Galeria at 10 blocks that is a huge mall, with target, Macy's and watever you may need to buy.I recommend getting a car because you've got 15 to 20 minutes to anywhere. The hotel is quite old but you have lcd in the room, good matress, pillows and bathing stuff, great view from our room we can see the sun rise over the hills and the snow mountains in the back. Very good experience.[...]

ReviewText:It was good for the price but internet access and breakfast were additional cost. The service were average. Do your homework on prices, services, and watch so you dont get double charged too in some services. THe gym didnt have variety and the swimming pool is outdoor and was cold to swim.

ReviewText:Wouldn't normally choose a Hilton because of price, but I got one night free with [...] so I thought it would be nice to stay somewhere more upscale. I was wrong! So many extra charges that [...]doesn't know about: $18/ day parking, $15/day high speed Internet, $15 for a room fridge. It even cost $2/ minute to use the Business Center to print out my boarding passes. And even though they have two restaurants, no complimentary Continental breakfast. All of these thing you can get for FREE at less pricey hotels-what exactly did I pay for????

ReviewText:Had a meeting in Burbank and this was the perfect hotel to be away from the congestion. Excellent staff and the views are terrific. Happy hour at the Skyline Lounge on the 19th floor is a great deal.

ReviewText:Have stayed here before, we like it's location, clean rooms and helpful staff. We don't like paying $18.00 a night for parking, but we know all good Hotels charge at least that, for us, its just one more added expense to traveling like luggage fees!
