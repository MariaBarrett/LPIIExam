ReviewText:A hotel that provides good value for money, and is very conveniently located for the airport.  The free shuttle bus to and from the airport was a bonus.

ReviewText:We were willing to overlook the age of the hotel, because it was almost charming. But there is absolutely no soundproofing between rooms, and the guy upstairs kept us awake ALL NIGHT!!! None of us got any sleep and we were all absolutely exhausted for our long flight the next day. We were going to change rooms, but we kept hoping this guy would fall asleep... No such luck! We got up, got dressed, and went down for breakfast at 5 a.m.!

ReviewText:Good Value and location close to airport with convenient airport shuttle.  I was in town for one day to take a licensing exam for medical school which was a short 15 minute walk away on Sepulveda.  I imagine this hotel would be very good for people who have layovers or disruption in their travel plans and need to spend another night in LA.  Food at bar was OK, not great, but I didn't try the other restaurant. Bar was a good place to catch a sports game.

ReviewText:This hotel was nice, close to airport, close to a lot of fast food & sit-down restaurants (most within walking distance of this hotel). I really liked my oversized room with a balcony that overlooked a very nicely landscaped courtyard below. Overall, I was very pleased with this hotel. I found the photos on this hotel's website actually matched what I saw in person. So that was BIG PLUS to me. This hotel had a very nice decor throughout the hotel, and it had a very nice cozy ambiance. -newline-  -newline- My only 4 complaints are: The elevator runs very slow and the lights were out on all of the buttons on the elevator, so you never knew what floor the elevator was on while you were waiting for it. Then when the elevator finally comes and you press the button for your floor, the button does not illuminate. The hallways to the rooms need to be updated. I stayed on the 5th floor, however since the elevator was so slow, I always used the stairway to walk down to the first floor, since it was much quicker. Also, I tried the coffee shop at this hotel (Mariposas Restaurant). However the service was very, very slow, poor, and unfriendly. Since there were 2 waiters serving about 8 people while I dined there, I could not believe how poor & slow the service was. So I would recommend going to one of the local coffee shops or restaurants down the street from this hotel. Yet other than that, I liked this hotel. -newline-  -newline- For the value, I would definitely stay at this hotel again, however I do not think I would patronize any of the restaurants at this hotel.

ReviewText:Had heard there were very nice renovated rooms, however, we did not get one. Our room was old and dated, with missing light fixture at door, damaged woodwork in bathroom.  It was, however, clean....thank goodness!  Staff was VERY pleasant and accommodating.  Okay if you just needed a bed for the night, but not for much else.  Disappointing, I'm afraid to say.

ReviewText:I had to get a place that provided airport transfere because I was comming in from a long business trip and meeting someone in LA.  The hotel provided free transportation that was convient. I also like the locations because there was other resturants to walk to and they provided transportation to the mall.  The resturant and lounge there at the hotel was nice too.

ReviewText:Trip was great, but I didn't get much sleep because it was so hot in the room. With central air conditioning, they had the heat on at night and I was not able to cool the room off at all. They did not help at front desk. There is no way to control the temp. in each room individually if you need it cooler than other people like. I will never recommend nor stay there again. The only bad part of the L.A. trip. There is a charge for parking too!
