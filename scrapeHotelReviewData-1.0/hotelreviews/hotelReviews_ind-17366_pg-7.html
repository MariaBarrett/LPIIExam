ReviewText:Very nice stay. I knew that there was a parking fee, but it was expensive and not stated up front nor could I get the hotel staff to tell me about the fee when I asked.

ReviewText:The only issue was the paid parking of $14. Paid parking should had been identified on the hotel add. It makes a difference in selection based on total cost of room rates

ReviewText:I had to move out of my house somewhat sudden. Afte that, I have been in probably 7 hotels in 3 weeks. This was the first place I stayed in the beginning. This is also the last one I am staying at. This has been by far the best hotel I have been to out of them all. The service is great, It allows pets, The room is a nice size and includes a nice desk, Resteraunt staff and room service staff are wonderful. I really have nothing bad that I can say about this place. Thank you Radisson!!

ReviewText:The location was great! Your by everything from the movies, a mall around the corner, to Nordstrom Rack. The hotel lobby was beautiful, the staff was friendly. The Bar area was awesome there was some live Jazz during the weekend so the area was busy. I was not to found of the bathroom because it was small and the water pressure was very low. You had to flush the toilet twice ÔÅå I was also not pleased with the high cost of parking per day. Overall it was quiet and nice I would stay their again only if I got a good rate I wouldn't dare pay the hotel price per night.
