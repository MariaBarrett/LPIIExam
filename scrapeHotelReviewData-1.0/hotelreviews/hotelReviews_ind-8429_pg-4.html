ReviewText:Outstanding location -- just minutes from Sunset Blvd., Beverly Hills, and other great venues -- all the while nestled in a quiet area surrounded by private residences and well-maintained condos and hotels. Staff was friendly and helpful. Terrific view from the rooftop pool. Gym is small and always available equipment. Will definitely return to Le Montrose.

ReviewText:While there hiked canyon in hollywood hills, beautiful view, Cruised Sunset Blvd, Shopped Beverly Center. Location was not as close to downtown Hollywood/Sunset Blvd as I would've liked. Hotel very nicely maintained, plush atmosphere. Really disappointed that coffee was not available, not in room, not in lobby. Only through room service or mini restaurant. Early mornings in nice hotels require coffee. Pool on rooftop nicely maintained offered a beautiful view. Nothing within walking distance. Parking lot was tiny and pricey

ReviewText:Hotel was one street back off Sunset Blvd. Ideal area to walk in- amongst residences. Very helpful staff, nothing was a hassle. Big + was that we were able to wash and dry our clothes in the Laundry facility. Restaurants within walking distance- all types and close to famous hotels such as 'Whiskey a go go'. Short $10 taxi fares to The Beverly Hills Centre. $30 fare to Universal Studios. Thank you to the staff for making our last few days in the USA a trip to remember!

ReviewText:Boutique style hotel, located just off the beat and path of the Sunset Strip.  This is one of Hollywood's hidden treasures.

ReviewText:Huge rooms with a lounge separated by a lower level as well as a walk in wardrobe. The restaurant on site looked old and tired so I did not try it. The roof top pool was nice during the day and at night with plenty of seats. Good location very close to Sunset Boulevard and a number of good restaurants that were recommended by the friendly staff.

ReviewText:Great amenities.  Real comfortable boutique suite feel.  Executive suite came with fireplace that was gas powered and great. Bar and refridgerator items weren't at a gouged price.  Two flat screen tv's and a spacious dressing area were nice additions.  Good fitness center and rood pool and jacuzzi rocks. Xlent part of town within walking distance of a lot of good restaurants.  Center of west hollywood made MANY things convenient.

ReviewText:Wouldn't know.  Despite confirming earlier in the day and telling that I would be checking in late, there was no room.  I also had issues where they sent me and I believe I will be double charged.
