ReviewText:Hotel looks beautiful in the photos online. You walk into the lobby, and it still looks lovely. After getting our room and walking through the hallways, everything from the walls to the carpet looked dirty and dingy. The room itself was clean, but the squeaky floors from upstairs sounded right through the ceiling and woke us up throughout the night, as did the thin walls in between rooms. The shower couldn't make up it's mind weather it was boiling hot, or too cold. Parking there sucks too. In short, I'm never staying there again!!

ReviewText:My first encounter with the staff was horrible, the front desk lady was completely rude. I didn't appreciate her attitude not one bit. After politely expressing myself she changed the way she was servicing me. Other than that pretty cool place to stay. Just not for me. Great eateries surrounding the hotel. Good eats.

ReviewText:An OK place to stay and very close to the Airport. This is an older hotel needing some updates but the staff was friendly and the place was kept clean and neat. Has a great heated pool and hot tub which are outdoors. Major drawback and added expense is the $8 per day parking that you are forced to pay if you have a car.
