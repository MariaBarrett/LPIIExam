ReviewText:The location could simply not be improved upon in downtown Los Angeles. It is near good shopping, etc. -newline-  -newline- The room itself was attractive, but "trendy" in an way not designed for comfort. The bed was a mattress and box springs on a 4 inch platform rather than a bed frame, so I would "roll out of bed" as standing up was odd. There was only a single, unpadded plastic chair in the room, which was inadequate. The television is a rather small one. The elevator was S-L-O-W and a problem. On the other hand, the staff was superb and the restaurant was open 24 hours. The valet parking service was able to get my car in less than one minute (repeatedly) which is much, much better than having to call 30 minutes prior to leaving and then just hoping that it is ready when you need it.

ReviewText:I stayed at the Huge room with a long size bed. This room was on the 12th floor and we had a great view! The Standard also has pool parties on the rooftop pool, and with my room I received free admission! Such nice front desk staff! Amazing place to stay! Highly recommend it!

ReviewText:The roof top at The Standard was so beautiful. Great view/atmosphere/pool. The rooms were ok. The shower is in the room with only glass separating the shower from the room. This is a problem if you are staying with family and want privacy. Kind of inconvenient. But I will return to the roof top for sure. The food is really good too!

ReviewText:It was an updated older hotel with fabulous rooftop bar and pool. While my mojito was a little expensive, overallit was a good experience, nice staff including housekeeping. I did try to order breakfast in the room when I got stuck doing work, but the line was busy for 20 minutes. I called the front desk and the girl in a flat monotone kept saying "line's busy hold" every 30 seconds. Perhaps there should be a larger kitchen staff or at least a system in which they call you back. Ended up going to a cafe an hour later.

ReviewText:My husband and I, along with a couple of friends absolutely loved the hotel!! the room was perfect..although we had booked a double bed and were given a single king size bed..because they did not have our room available! The rooftop pool is amazing..we will definitely stay here next time!!

ReviewText:I hate that they had a "bouncer" to get into the room elevators. Everyone had to check in to get into my room. Sometimes I had to go down and get them. What's the point of getting a large room if you can't have people in it. It was like getting into a night club, it was ridiculous. The rooms are cool looking and modern, but that kinda dampered my night.
