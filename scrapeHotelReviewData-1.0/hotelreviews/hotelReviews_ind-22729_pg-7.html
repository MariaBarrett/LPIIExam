ReviewText:It was a good choice of location for us within walking distance of Walt Disney Concernt Hall, theaters, and the new Catholic Cathedral.  It's on the edge of Japan Town which we found interesting to explore.  We had a problem with the hot water.  When we finally called, the staff responded immediately, were very friendly, and helped us move to a new room since they could not resolve it right away.

ReviewText:We were deceived by the photo slides of the Hotel Room. Thinking that we will be staying in a more stylish room, we went ahead to booked this hotel. However, when we got into the hotel room, we realised that its not what we see from this site. We managed to ask the hotel front desk, they mentioned that that room is an executive room. It was no where mentioned in the site. Tried calling the manager a couple of times. But not replies from him. What kind of customer service is that?

ReviewText:Adequate is how I would describe this hotel.  It is very close to the federal buildings if you need to be in that area.  However, the rooms are dated, they definately need some attention, the bathroom was uncomfortable in its layout.  The lobby was very nice and the Japanese rooftop garden is a plus if you're traveling with a group.  There is a parking lot directly accross the street if you need to save a few bucks on parking. The room rate was good compared to other hotels in the vicinity so if you need a fair rate it should work for you.

ReviewText:I was glad to see that the hotel still has a Japanese feel.  Valet parking was excellent.  The room was fine.  Fitness center had old lightweight treadmills and was too small.
