ReviewText:Great little hotel. Had lovely grounds and staff were friendly. When we had a problem with our first room, they were happy to move us promptly! The walls of the hotel were quite thin but overall it was a lovely stay! Worth what you paid for in a safe neighbourhood!

ReviewText:While the rooms are getting a bit dated and long in the tooth, the staff was outstanding and professional.  The Valet Parking/Concierge was one of the best I've ever experienced.  Asked where I wanted to park, gave me advice and even recommended a spot close to my room.  Thanks!

ReviewText:We stayed here because we needed a room for one night before leaving for LAX after a trip to Palm Springs.  This was a great location for the things we wanted to see before we left.  It was close to Rodeo Dr. Westwood village/UCLA and Beverly Hills.  We arrived late and was taken care of the beds were turned down and lights on.  We had a junior Executive suite with a kitchenette and living area.  The bath was small but nice. There were 2 things that we didn't like one the smell...but for the age of the hotel it was understandable and the location of the room. And second, it was all the end of a hall right on Wilshire but no windows facing the street.

ReviewText:Upgraded to beautiful suite at a very cheap price. Very classy boutique style hotel. Bell service could have been better. It was hard work carrying our bags upon arrival. -newline- Bus service at the door to downtown Hollywood. Hotel situated within minutes of famous houses eg  Michael Jackson, Elvis and Hugh Heffner.

ReviewText:I had traveled alot the night I drove up to the Beverly Hills Hotel. I was tired and the Valet was so kind and helpful in assisting with everything. All I had to do was walk to my fantastic room. For a weary traveler this was a perfect place to stay. -newline-  -newline- Thanks
