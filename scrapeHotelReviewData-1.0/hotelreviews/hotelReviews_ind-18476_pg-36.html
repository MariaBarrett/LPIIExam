ReviewText:It's an old structure, but well kept up and the open air patios are charming. Given the economical price, the room decor is quite nice.  The bed was comfortable and the linens nice; the staff was friendly; the location was convenient with a grocery and eateries just across the street.  Free parking and wifi. Great bargain, and we'll go back.

ReviewText:We booked very late when our flight out was canceled.  We got to the hotel at 5AM. The desk clerk and security guy were wonderful but we were not happy to have to change room because the first one had no heat. We got to sleep at 7AM.  We had to check out by 2 and spent 2-7 in the lobby and bar, working on our claim.  It was freezing in the lobby and not much warmer in the bar.  I have a cold now.

ReviewText:We got a great deal on this hotel [...].  But when we got there in the late evening, they gave us a room in the West Wing building.  It is very poorly lit and old in the West Wing.  My wife and I were not comfortable staying there.  I asked for a different room and they gave us a room in the main building for no extra charge.  It was much better.  So if you don't stay in the West Wing building, it is a good hotel.  Cheap parking and a bunch of restaurants close by.

ReviewText:Among the hotels around LAX airport, we chose this one because of the price within the same radius from the airport. The shower was horrible, bed was not uncomfortable but can't complain for the price. The price includes sit-down breakfast for two but didn't eat there because we didn't have time.

ReviewText:The people at the counter were rude and not help full, the restaurant food was disgusting. The coocks touched bacon with bare hands and dumped it into plates, every waiter touched food with bare hands, the food they served me for breakfast was gross. Felt like throwing up right after I saw it! The operators i'n the lobby locked annoyed every time they were asked a question, and one of the girls did not even bother to answer one of my questions.

ReviewText:conveniently located around vicinity of LAX. Hotel has a little restaurant for meals and breakfast was included in the hotel price - good hearty american breakfast. Also hotel located across from several fast food outlets which was useful for a light snack as we arrived rather late. One disadvantage of hotel was the shuttle bus to hotel, which while complimentary, did not come around as often as expected. required a call to hotel to inform of need for the ride. still, service was generally good overall.
