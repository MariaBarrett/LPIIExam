ReviewText:The overall experience was nice.  After a long/noisy night at a concert nearby we were hungry.  Tried to order room service at 12:00 am off the "Late Night" room service menu.  The operator informed us that "Room Service closed at 11:00 PM".  I offered a friendly suggestion of removing the Late Night Room Service Menu from the hotel information book to receive "is their anything else you need" from the other end of the phone.  Hmmm!!

ReviewText:The Biltmore Hotel was a much nicer Hotel that I thought it would be. The staff was very friendly and had no problems with anything. I stayed with a friend to attend a convention. Only thing I had a problem was the location. Not much to do around the hotel, have to walk a bit to get to anything nice. The price was about half the cost of any other Hotel around the convention center. I would stay again and recommend this spot for anyone else that wants a nice cheap Hotel.

ReviewText:It is an old hotel and the rooms aren't modern.  The location was convenient for the purpose of my visit.  The lobby, halls and ballrooms are impressive.

ReviewText:PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE! -newline-  -newline- First and foremost parking is $40 a night, even if you are staying at the hotel, and it took 45 minutes for the valet to pull my car out front. -newline-  -newline- I made a reservation for this hotel because it had a very good price (of $100 a night).  I was suppose to stay Friday night and Saturday, however there was a change to my business meetings and I had to come in on Thursday.  The rate for Thursday, however changed, and I was charged $220.  When I asked to talk to a manager about this price jump they told me that I would receive parking for free as a gift.  Figuring I had no other choice, I regretfully accepted. -newline-  -newline- Their mood was very different upon arrival because I was still charged $40 for parking and when I told them I was suppose to receive it for free the manager laughed in my face (literally, which was one of the rudest experiences of my life). -newline-  -newline- Secondly, I had a late meeting Friday night and came home around 12:30, and wanted to order from their "24 hour" room service.  But sometimes when they are slow, they decide to let their staff go early and close down their room service without notice.  I hadn't eaten since lunch and asked what I could do, which I got a response of "There's a Taco Bell and a Subway about a mile away."  I then asked if I could pre-order breakfast to my room so I could just go to bed and have it there when I wake, and she told me that "was against hotel policy."  I then called down the front desk and asked if I could use the hotel car to take me to a late night deli to get a bite to eat and was told that again "was against hotel policy" and was told again that there is a 24 hour Subway about a mile from the hotel!!! -newline-  -newline- They literally wanted me to walk alone in a strange downtown at 1 am to get food!  And they call this a 4 star hotel?!!?!?!?! -newline-  -newline- PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE!

ReviewText:when I was at the hotel  we used the pool once. really cmfortable beds but we didn't recieve the club room we booked online. when we tried to upgrade they told us to wait a day so we did and when we tried again they told us they couldn't get us one. extremely upset about that because we paid extra a night  to get a nicer room. tried to order room service one night because it said it was open from 10pm-6am, we called down there and they said it was closed when it shouldn't have been. was a nice hotel but overall was just ok, staff was kind of rude and didn't get ideally what we wanted.
