ReviewText:The location was perfect for everywhere we needed to be. It was a welcome respite from the mid-day heat and offered a very comfortable, restful bed. The kitchenette was just what we needed and all the extras were perfect. The hotel bar closed a little too early for our schedules, but the bartenders still sold us beers to take back to the room. A pleasant surprise overall and much better than expected. Will definitely come and stay again - and recommend!

ReviewText:The moment you walk in, the hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff is extremely friendly. Our room was beautiful and was so very comfortable. The location was great for Burbank. It's next to the 134 Freeway and right across the street from a Vons for anything you may have forgotten. There's no doubt the next time I need to stay anywhere near the valley, I'll definitely be staying at Hotel Amarano

ReviewText:The only parking was valet. This was an additional 35 dollars a day. I thought this was an excessive amount since we were hotel guest. I was traveling with a disabled person and could not park, on the street a block away.

ReviewText:First I have got to say is if you are reading this then you are at least remotely interested... Do it. It's worth it. My boyfriend and I needed a place to stay out in valley area after having a concert and club night we both knew we didn't want to drive up to Ventura County at 3am. -newline-  -newline- All pictures shown on web are accurate. Beautiful room with a very comfy bed. The modern look gave me a relaxing feel with a mixture of texture walls and soft linens. Our room had a beautiful belcony that had a pool side view. -newline-  -newline- I had two things I saw as negative but not deal breakers... 1). Valet parking that costs $30 bucks for overnight guest... Way over priced, since we are Southern Cali residents we travel light so parking the car on the street one block was not an issue, 2). There is no view from any room. That being said since the inside is so comfy, hopefully you won't want to look out. :)

ReviewText:I was looking for a last-minute hotel for an overnight visit to the L.A. area (I live in OC). Stumbled upon Amarano at a great discounted rate just a few hours before my intended check-in. The hotel was fantastic for the price I paid ($139 for a standard King). Fully-stocked kitchenette, great flat screen TV, cozy bed. The only downside was that it got really crowded at around 7 pm. Their small valet area simply could not accommodate the rush of cars coming into the hotel. It took us 20 minutes to get our car, with quite a bit of chaos as the 2 lone valets struggled to move cars to give us room to exit. Other than that, though, it was a great visit.

ReviewText:The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room and the hotel were clean and very nice. There were some areas that needed attention. One of the lamps in our room was seriously broken, and the blankets were old and thin and scratchy and stained. The bathroom door didn't lock. But I think they are in the middle of a big remodel most everything was new and nice. The pool was very nice, and they had a very nice fitness room. The staff was great.The location and neighbor hood were great. All in all, it wasn't perfect but it was nice and we had a pleasant stay. I would stay there again. I can't wait to see it when it's finished.

ReviewText:Despite internal rivalry over the Rose Bowl game, we all enjoyed a few days at this Burbank Hotel. Location is convenient to both freeways and to park/ride for light rail. Convenient for tours of Hollywood neighborhoods and movie studios. Good restaurants in area.

ReviewText:I came to Burbank to go to Unversal Studios for the Halloween horror night. I didn't think I would get a great deal for booking this hotel last minute. the hotel shuttle picked us up from the airport. I expected it to be a shuttle bus, but it turned out to be a limo-like sedan. this hotel is small, but cozy and I like it better than a big hotel. it was very luxurious. workers were very friendly and I would love to stay here again.

ReviewText:We are a family of 4. Stayed here because it had rooms available on a short notice and was close to Universal Studios. Had room 402, top floor. -newline- PROS: -newline- Location - a few miles from Universal studios theme park and Warner Brother’s studios is almost walking distance from the hotel. Neighborhood was very nice, with grocery store and restaurants directly across the street. It was located in a residential area, which made it less noisy. -newline- Room - Great T.V. Big spacious room, new carpet (new carpet in entire hotel) and new granite bathroom sink area and bar area. -newline- Staff - Very nice and accommodating. -newline- Hotel - Can tell it was newly renovated. Nice lobby. -newline- CONS: -newline- Parking - You will shell out $30.00 for valet parking whether you want it or not. No self-parking available -newline- Shower - Oops, Someone forgot to renovate the shower. Pink and black mold very visible in the WHITE grout. Very easy fix too, just spray BLEACH on it and walk away....geez! -newline- Beds - Although they were comfortable they were SMALL!!! They were very small "FULL" mattresses. This didn’t make sense (besides saving the hotel big $$) because the room was more than big enough to accommodate 2 queen beds. Two adults together will not sleep well on them, small kids do okay. -newline- Pricey snack bar in room – They have snacks and a stocked fridge in the room for purchase. Just make sure your little one doesn’t open the fridge and have a feast. My daughter opened the gummy bears before I could explain they were not complimentary and that cost me $5.50 + tax. -newline- No Pool – They do have a spa on the top floor though. Didn’t see it, so all I can say is they have one. However, the front office clerk did say they were in the process of adding a pool. -newline- Would I stay here again, maybe, if I got a good rate. I liked the location.
