ReviewText:Hotel lobby was amazing and top notch, so was our bedroom which had an amazing view of downtown. I would've given this hotel five stars but I had one issue that upset me during my stay. -newline- The hotel staff will not notify you about the parking situation because they are hoping you'll use the valet service which costs $40 a day. We assumed that the valet was included in the hotel price, but later found out by the additional charge on our bill. The concierge finally told us about the cheap parking a block away at checkout. -newline- Other than the parking issue it was a fine hotel.

ReviewText:I told the front desk to make sure the room we were staying at was quiet but at 3am the people next to us were so loud coming down the hall and extremely loud next to us...I swear it sounded like there was 10 of them in the room. I couldn't go back to sleep right after that.

ReviewText:This is a grand hotel which can be enjoyed in many different ways depending on budget. Simply walking the lobby and halls is great. Bar is superb. -newline-  -newline- There is a closed courtyard for smoking that is secure and on ground level a short distance from the lounge. The spectacular gift boutique features hi-grade cigars by the way.

ReviewText:We really enjoyed our stay here.  It is a beautiful hotel with an interesting part in the history of Hollywood. -newline-  -newline- The staff was very nice and helpful as we didn't really know our way around.  The (indoor) pool is awesome with a Turkish bath feel to it, but fairly small and not meant for children playing around really (tiling around the pool gets really slippery).  Our room was OK, but not necessarily living up to the aesthetic of the lobby (it felt a bit dated, but very clean). -newline-  -newline- All in all it was a great stay- would definitely go back or recommend to a friend!

ReviewText:Great downtown location.  Large room, although it was sparse on furniture.  We moved a round side table from the side of the room so that we both had bedside tables. It's an old hotel but still maintained well.  Valet parking was expensive($40)but with free in-and-out, and very prompt retrieval service, it was still a good deal. (Especially considering the great rate we got with Orbitz.)  Room service breakfast was served at the time requested, and was very good. -newline-  -newline- We booked two rooms and both couples were very happy with the stay.

ReviewText:Great interior of the hotel! The rooms are less glamorous than the entrance but fair for the price.

ReviewText:Classic hotel right downtown. Room was spacious, quiet, and well kept. Staff were very courteous, friendly and helpful. Slept like a baby in the comfortable bed.  I wish all hotels would offer free internet.

ReviewText:Dont stay near the end of the hall overlooking the street. The windows are not sound proof, so the traffic noise will wake you up. Other than that, the hotel is great. It is a gorgeous hotel (they dont make hotels like this anymore), and the staff are top notch.
