ReviewText:A friend of mine and I stayed at this hotel for the excellent prices and prime location for the LA Marathon. It was a great experience! The valet were super friendly and they were anticipating my arrival. Walking into the hotel, I got the impression that the hotel was a lounge you'd find at an upscale bar or club. Checking in was easy and their theme is cute with the "Hello! My name is ..." cards. The room was cozy and cute. The shower was a glass case for the rest of the room to see. The bed was very comfortable. I have no complaints and the service was excellent! I would definitely stay here again.

ReviewText:Standard is very trendy. Rooftop bar is awesome. You get two passes to go to the bar if you stay with the hotel, which is nice. Excellent toiletries and amenities. Only downside is that the hotel is a total party zone so don't be surprised to be surrounded by drunken neighbors in the middle of the night.

ReviewText:Great hotel very very funky and great location.  The negatives, the night club in the hotel is really LOUD and can be heard right through the building.  Also you are given a key at check in for the mini bar in your room.  Once you unlock the fridge you are charged $2.20 for simply opening it.  Ridiculous charges like that are BS.

ReviewText:Great Hotel and ideal location for staying in downtown area. Very clean and good concept with the glass shower (no secrets). The only downfall was the noise at nite esp towards the weekend, can hear guests making loud noises after party from their rooftop. -newline- Good hippie place but not for oldies like me cos you just can't get enough sleep from the noise -newline- Service wasn't great either as the lady receptionist wasn't too nice when i asked a few more queries. Quite impatient...

ReviewText:The Standard was actually a great choice for a hotel!  It's fabulously quirky and interesting.  Not the kind of place that I'd stay with my wife and kids (the shower walls were transparent glass), but definitely memorable when it's just me.

ReviewText:Upbeat place but I did not think to request a non-smoking floor and was too exhausted with a late-night arrival to request a change. -newline- Very pleasant and helpful desk attendant.
