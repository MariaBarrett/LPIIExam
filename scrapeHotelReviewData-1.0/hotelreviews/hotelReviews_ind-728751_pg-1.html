ReviewText:The Roof restaurant is not 4-star restaurant at all. -newline- It has a nice view but cold. No good selections of dinner. -newline-  -newline- It is nice for free coffee at the 2nd floor. -newline- They should serve a free coffee and sell some continental food in the morning at the ROOF. -newline-  -newline- At 2nd floor they should serve as a drinking place.

ReviewText:The hotel I stayed at is a bit pricey but worth every cent! The staff comped me with free breakfast for my stay, the valet service is exemplary and the front desk personnel bent over backwards to accomodate me when it appeared something was missing from my room after being out for the day. Nothing was missing (my error) and all I can say is that next time I head out to LA, I will certainly go through this site and book a room at this hotel. -newline- Bob :-)

ReviewText:I booked this hotel for its proximity to CBS Studios which was about a mile away, but walkable. -newline- I thought it was a really good value. I liked being able to go to the gym about a block away, LACMA close, hop-on hop-off tour bus close, staff very helpful, happy hour was nice, the room was great, and I liked the dining options across the street. I was very happy with my decision to stay here.

ReviewText:We came to the Wilshire for a weekend in LA. The location is amazing! Close to Beverly hills, Weho and UCLA where we attended a concert. -newline- The rooftop pool was also awesome. Sipping on cappuccinos in the morning while chilling by the pool and all of that with a Hollywood sign view. -newline- The points to improve are: -newline- -Room cleanliness. Let me explain, the room was very clean when we go there, but once inside the room, the daily service would be bare minimum (making the bed and re-hanging towels). -newline- - Rooftop bar service. I know you guys are packed, but waiting 40 minutes for a cappuccino is not an option. -newline-  -newline- I would definitely come back here! But next time I'll have my cappuccino prior to hitting the pool.

ReviewText:Very attractive rooms and an amazing rooftop pool with decent restaurant. But no fitness center - you get free pass to LA fitness 4 blocks away. Many empty store front in surrounding blocks makes the neighborhood unappealing. Next time I'll look for same quality in a nicer neighborhood

ReviewText:The amenities that were advertised by the hotel were not available as described (e.g. there was no breakfast served at the said location, and no signs to point to some alternate location). It may just be me having used to sleep on memory foam bed and pillow, but I found the bed (hard, spring) and pillows (feather) very uncomfortable. Tap water was not really drinkable due to all chlorine content, while this isn't hotel's fault, not addressing this by simply having bottled water available in the rooms could have been a simple mitigation to the issue. -newline- On the other hand, clean rooms, ok location, nice restaurant at the roof were positive points. Rooms have a nice TV, along with (almost) every possible way to connect your electronic devices, alarm clock (iHome), coffee machine and a safe.

ReviewText:Perhaps a bit expensive for one night, it was none the less lovely. Location to concert venue, just up the street, was perfect. The staff was incredibly patient and helpful.
