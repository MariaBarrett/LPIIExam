ReviewText:The rooms were very nice and the views of Universal Studios were amazing.  Service was impeccable and the buffet was one of the best we have ever had.  The people who work at this Hilton spare no expense.  We loved this resort and would definitely return!  Extremely nice experience!  Loved the shuttle service to and from the park.

ReviewText:got the handicapped room in the basement. usually i get complimentary fruit and nuts and or water.. i didnt get anything. Bath was a special handicapped type shallow bath and i was looking forward to a warm soak after a long drive but could not in this particular bath. shower head was a plastic cheesey type that sprayed everywhere and not just down... I was not impressed at all -newline-  -newline- then i got charged $123 dollars on my debit card additional on next day for valet parking for 1 night, ill assume it was a mistake but i need to call and correct or fight.

ReviewText:It's only a walk away from Universal studios and city walk. The service was exceptionable and the personable. Great place to stay for one or the whole family. Its the only place I will consider if I go there again.

ReviewText:Very nice and clean hotel.  Easy access to the Metro via shuttle.  Universal City Walk and easy stroll from the hotel when those shuttles aren't running.  Noticed we only had decaf coffee one day, and the fully leaded was delivered in minutes after a call to the front desk.  Lobby Starbucks makes a terrific mocha, and the hot pastry stuffed with potatoes or meat makes a good quick breakfast for those not into the big buffet.  Frig in the room so you can chill your own drinks.

ReviewText:Service was great.  The location is a short walk away from lots of fun at City Walk and Universal Studios.  The only thing is that there is an extra fee for internet use.  Overall my stay was great.
