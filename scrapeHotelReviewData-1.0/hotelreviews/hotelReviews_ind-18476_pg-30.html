ReviewText:The room did not match the pictures and turned out to be more on the level of a Motel 6 for double the price. -newline-  -newline- The parking was a problem. The parking lot was full and cars were parked where ever they could. -newline-  -newline- The room was noisy and the pillows were so hard I had trouble falling a sleep. -newline-  -newline- All of this may be expected had the room not been expensive and have the price I paid for it.

ReviewText:it was a ok stay... nothing to write home about... No free parking.... I'm cheap so paying someone to move bags to room was not going to happen... Sucked a bit if you have a lot of bags.. I did not have frige.. not sure if other rooms have them. Free shutlle from airport is nice

ReviewText:The hacienda hotel is big and old, the paint is chipped off in alot of places and the elevator was malfunctioning 33% of the time. That being said, this was still a good buy. -newline-  -newline- I personally did not like how the pool closed at 8pm and opens at 8am. Because in LA i'm gone all day and cannot make it there in time to relax in the pool at the end of the day. -newline-  -newline- PROS -newline- -friendly staff -newline- -free ice and water near lobby -newline- -cheap -newline- -mini fridge in the room -newline-  -newline- CONS -newline- -only one luggage cart in the ENTIRE hotel! -newline- -pool only open from 8am - 8pm -newline- -no free breakfast stuff besides coffee -newline- -no complementary toothbrush or razors -newline- -no microwaves in the hotel rooms -newline- -paid parking lot only takes cash(this is a con for me because i don't carry cash on me 90% of the time)

ReviewText:I was in the main building. The room only had one open socket, so we ended up unplugging a lot of stuff. We're pretty sure our room was haunted. Lights would turn on and off by themselves and so would the tv. The tv blew up at one point, but they quickly replaced it. Pool is nice.

ReviewText:I stayed here twice (coming and going) and this experience describes both times. -newline-  -newline- Staff was friendly, hotel is decently clean. -newline- Checkin line wait is ridiculously long. Took 35 mins to process about 8 people working with 3 staff. -newline- Airport shuttle experience was great. -newline-  -newline- This hotel is great for arriving and departing but consider it basic accommodations only. I hate that they only give 2 small threadbare towels and plastic cups to drink the water. -newline-  -newline- Hotel is clean but you can see where they've patched things badly over the years. The elevators are a bit scary.

ReviewText:Very old hotel. We had to wait to get checked in due to lack of help, then they did not have reservation[...] But biggest shock is NO AC. Here it is 80 degrees or more and no AC. They make it hard to know this as they hide this fact. We would have never stayed here and next time will sleep at LAX. Terrible hotel [...]

ReviewText:Unexpected charge was added to the bill.  Before leaving the hotel this morning, I was wondering how come I didn't have a receipt.  Therefore, instead of make an express check out which I really should, I stopped by the front desk and requested a receipt to be printed. A lady named [...] at front desk was very rude.  Not only didn't she print out receipt for me, but also she asked me to pay $5.00 parking that no one had mentioned to me while I was check in.  I parked my car in the parking lot of Hacienda Hotel by the South Tower where the sign showed that for Hacienda Hotel guest only.  And it didn't specify that the guest would pay $5.00 as parking charge.  Of cause I paid the parking then left.  But before leaving, I checked all the signs in the parking lot near by the South Tower again that none of them marked $5.00 parking for the hotel guest.  How ridicules it was if I had made an express check out I would save $5.00.  Also, the hotel is old.  It took me a while to make the faucet work before taking the shower.  Overall, I am very disappointed about the service and will never go back to Hacienda Hotel again no matter how attractive the price will be.

ReviewText:The line to get a hotel room was about 20minutes, even though we had a reservation. but because we got it from [...]we were just like walk ins but with a paid room. if you reserve directily from the hotel you will get a continental breakfast, but others wise you just get a room. The hotel is very beautiful and close to LAX with free to and from shuttles. Its worth the under hundred a night, but unless you book from them dirrectly no more than that.
