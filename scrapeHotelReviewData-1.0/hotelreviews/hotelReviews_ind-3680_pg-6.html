ReviewText:Stayed at this hotel as it was the venue for a trade show - very convenient. Room nice on the surface, but maid service was lacking. Didn't clean/replace dirty glasses, ammenities and left long dark hairs in the bathroom. Lighting bad, especially if you want to read in bed. Bed was very comfortable and the shower had great water pressure. Could hear the people in the ajoining rooms and in the hallways. No restaurant, just a lobby bar. Not a great layout for the trade show, but it worked okay. If show gets much bigger - will have to move.

ReviewText:Comfortable; staff helpful enough. Noise of air conditioning was problematic (enough to wake you in the night) but dining options are nice and the location is wonderful (within walking distance of shopping, dining, Old Town, entertainment).

ReviewText:Nicely located hotel, vibrant "downtown" area is very close.  The hotel is somewhat old though, biggest pet peeve is no fan in the bathroom!

ReviewText:The room was somewhat small, but this may be a constraint from refurbishing an older building.  However, it did not come with a small refrigerator, which was a real surprise, there is no vent fan in the bathroom (so the bathroom steams up quickly), and weirdly, the storage rack for the bath towels is inside the enclosure for the shower over the tub.  The room was close to the elevators, and when I was hoping for total quiet at night, there was an intermittent low mechanical rolling sound in the walls, which must have been from the movement of the elevator counterweights.  When we left in the morning, we rang the bell captain for help with the bags.  After 10 minutes or more, he finally showed up.  I told him we had been about to leave without him.  He seemed apologetic, but then launched into a series of small romantic songs as we went down the hall and got in the elevator.  I finally asked him what would it take to get him to stop singing, and he finally got the point.      A very strange stay.  I don't care to repeat the experience.  Over-priced too, considering the amenities.
