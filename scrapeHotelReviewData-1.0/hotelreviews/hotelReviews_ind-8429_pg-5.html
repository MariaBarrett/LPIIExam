ReviewText:There are several boutique hotels in West LA that are former apartment buildings.  As such, they tend to be all suite hotels, with generous living/dining space, private balconies and small kitchens.  This is a much better value than a larger resort hotel if you plan on spending any time relaxing in your room.  Be forwarned the kitchens don't come fully stocked, but the hotel will provide you with everything you need should you decide to do some of your own meal prep.  They converted the small fridge to a mini-bar so I had to move the beverages to make room for my wine and cheese, but it was not a big deal.  Beautiful roof top pool and hot tub with great views, and a roof top tennis court too.  You can't beat this place if you want to be walkable to the West Hollywood bars/clubs (very close to Abbey, etc).  Also very walkable up to all the cafes and retail shops as well as the live music clubs up on Sunset.  Parking is $30 a night, but that's West LA. Staff was friendly and attentive.  I would definitely stay here again, much nicer than the Ramada, not as large or trendy as the London.

ReviewText:This hotel is great.  The hotel was very clean and quiet and the hotel staff were very friendly.  The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to Santa Monica Blvd and Sunset Blvd.  If your going on your own 80's hair band bar hopping tour this is the place to stay because you won't need a cab to get to and from the Whisky, Viper Room, Roxy or the Rainbow Bar and Grill on Sunset.  You can walk to them all in less than 5 minutes.  By the way, the scene at the Rainbow in the November Rain video was shot in booth 6 in the corner.  The walk from the hotel down to Santa Monica Blvd is a little farther than Sunset - maybe 10 minutes.  The view from the roof of the hotel is amazing!  I recommend the Star Line Tour that goes to the beaches, all over LA and movie star homes.  You basically get to see everything in one day and then can go back to a few things for a little longer like the walk of fame.  Actually, the star line office is behind the walk of fame and Chinese Theatre so if you arrive early for your tour, you could explore the walk of fame before the tour starts.  The tour drops you off on the side with the Chinese theatre so you may want to cruise the other side of the street first.  Enjoy Venice Beach.  You will find that it is not at all what they make it look like on TV!!  I don't want to ruin the surprise so you will have to see for yourselves.

ReviewText:We stayed the Le Montrose hotel and we visitied the La Brea Tarpits and Universal Studios.  Each of those parks were within 5 miles of the hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The pool was very nice and quiet and waas perfect for the hotel.  The 30 dollars a day for parking was a bit much, but there really is not much space to park anywhere else.  It was one of the best family trips we have ever taken and the hotel was a perfect place to be with the family.

ReviewText:The location is not a very good area of town.  It is difficult, at best, to get to sightseeing opportunities.  Traffic, in and out, of the area is horrible.  No easy access to the freeways. -newline- They advertise, "full kitchens"...(What a joke!!!). -newline- Yes, they have full kitchens, but they are not furnished with dishes, cookware, utensils, etc.  You have to ask for everything to be brought to your room, as you think of what you need, which is very inconvenient. -newline- The room layouts on the internet are NOT what you get.  While the rooms are nice, it is not what you expect from the internet pics (floor plans). -newline- Valet service is great, but very expensive compared to any other locations we have stayed at. -newline- Staff was very friendly and helpful. -newline- We definitely would NOT return to this hotel.

ReviewText:Stayed here because of price & reviews.  Best price compared to surrounding 4 star hotels in west hollywood.  I had friends who stayed at The Andaz Hotel a mile away, and I think Le Montrose is better!  Although the pool is small, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful!  Loved the valet service, wish it was cheaper and not $30 a night.  You really don't have a choice, considering the hotel is surrounded by residences and there is no st parking unless you have a permit.  Fabulous hotel for a night on the town with friends!

ReviewText:Overall the hotel was very nice, a little old but the people were nice which made up for it.  The room was spacious but the bathroom was super small, okay for one but no more than that, it would be hard for a couple to stay there.

ReviewText:For an out of town visitor, the location can not be beat.Slightly hidden(meaning safety  and security), yet close to everything. I would call this a true hidden gem. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool, spa, and tennis court are great, too.
