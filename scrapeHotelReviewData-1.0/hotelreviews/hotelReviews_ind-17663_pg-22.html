ReviewText:If you want a hotel/motel that exceeds cleanliness standards, this is your place. If you want a place where the staff is just too helpful, this is the place. They don't waste time and money changing your bed if it doesn't need it. The cleaners were out and about from early morning 'til late at night. You can ask them for help anytime. ONLY one problem... I only found one that spoke any English. Since this is America I think that this should be recified even a little. There is a 24-hour restaurant on the site and as I kept weird hours, it was great (but I wish they would clean the restaurant really good , especially the carpet. This is the best place I have ever stayed in and everytime I visit the Los Angeles area, I will return. It was away from the airport yet easy access to suburbs (as long as you stay off the 405) Thank you

ReviewText:Rooms were very clean, nice beds and not the standard ugly, dirty covers as in most hotels. No breakfast, but the Denny's is right in front of the hotel. Fast check-in and check-out!

ReviewText:Online offers microwave on request, but they charge extra per day. Hum..they forgot to bring it to the room. They reset locks for no reason, of course when my hands were full trying to get in the room. URR... watch out for lady begger at all hours. Overall it was alright, but would not be on the top of my list next time.

ReviewText:I have stayed here several times. It is centrally located and the price is more than reasonable. There is no charge for parking.
