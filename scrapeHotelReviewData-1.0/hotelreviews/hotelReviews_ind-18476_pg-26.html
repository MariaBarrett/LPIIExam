ReviewText:The hotel is in a fairly convenient location and is in fairly good condition, just a little worn around the edges. We found out at check in that we would be charged an additional $8 per day for parking, what they didn't tell us is their parking lots are constantly full! We came back at 11pm after our first full day and found the lot full with 4 or 5 other hapless guests driving around in circles! Ended up parking on the street where some dirtbag stole the valve stem caps off our rental car. Only other issue was the bathtub drain. Problem is it didn't.

ReviewText:My husband left his billfold on the shuttle and your driver took the extra effort to bring it to the airport and even offered me his cell phone to locate my husband as he was headed back to the hotel. You can't ask for better honest folks than that....

ReviewText:Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. It is pretty close to the airport w/a 24hr shuttle to/from so that is super convenient. -newline- The hotel itself was lacking. They were painting parts of it when I arrived which will help but other areas, my room especially were not up to my standard. -newline- Upon first glance the room looked spiffy but as I settled in, I noticed things that should be taken care of... The paint by the windows was bubbled and peeling; there was a crack in the ceiling by the window; the window had been covered with some kind of film (probably to help keep the room cool) but it was bubbled and peeling. -newline- The thermostat did not give you an option of heat or A/C... I ended up opening a window... Def needs updating. -newline- The bathroom was clean but when they renovated it they failed to replace the faucets (which made a horrific squealing sound when you turned on the shower/tub- I'm sure the people next to me appreciated that when I showered at 3am!). The knob to turn the bath into a shower leaked profusely! The sink had old faucets too which also squeaked but not like the banshee-sounding shower! The mirror needs replaced. Period. It had black and brown age spots ALL over it giving the bathroom a feeling of uncleanliness! -newline- The bath towels were a dingy grey and old... -newline- The lock and key fob were a great pain! I stood outside my room for 5mins trying to get the lock to register the key... It was that touchy! -newline- Overall, it looks like they are in the process of renovating, and not completely finished... Parts were nice and parts were very poor. -newline- Like I said, they're trying but they're falling short... Not worth what I paid for the room.

ReviewText:I only spent one night at the hotel. There was a free shuttle from the airport . My wait was about 20 minutes - OK. The room was clean and there is a nice restaurant attached plus a supermarket just across the street. The internet connection was free and good, the room was clean and quiet; the bed was comfortable and there was a fitness room in the hotel. Too bad about no coffee maker in the rooms as that would have made the stay even more enjoyable. All in it was a nice place and I recommend it.

ReviewText:Located near LAX with a shuttle every 15 minutes, the Hacienda Hotel felt much to me like a DoubleTree but cost substantially less. The only downside I found was that the bathtub/shower plumbing was a bit sub-par. I had to try three times to get the water coming out of the shower head completely, as opposed to having it split output between the shower head and the tub faucet. There was some mold under the tub mat too, but not so much as to concern me and nowhere that you would contact with your skin (UNDER the tub mat).

ReviewText:The shuttle picked me up at the airport, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, from the front desk to housekeeping. The room was clean, although old. I had room service, which was very good food, and the device was outstanding. -newline- This is a perfect place to stay near the airport if you are laying over between flights, and I would stay here again.

ReviewText:The location was handy for a quick layover at LAX. The 24 hour shuttle was a bonus for access from and back to LAX. The shuttle staff was courteous and efficient. For being so close to the airport the room was very quiet for traffic noise. The walls were somewhat thin and conversations from the room beside could be heard as well as the phone. The room was clean and average but the bathroom required some maintanence as the plaster was peeling from above the tub. There was no in room coffee making ability which would have been a plus. Overall, the room was average.

ReviewText:Central location makes it a good place to stay but there is no fan in the bathroom and so the room smells musty. -newline- There were 4 of us and we were there 3 days and we couldn't seem to get the staff to remember to give us 4 towels. Front desk was very responsive when we called for more but by the 3rd day that was getting old! -newline- Small room, no view but we were only there to shower and sleep, so it was fine. -newline- Great location for sightseeing in LA.
