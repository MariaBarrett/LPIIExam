ReviewText:In LA for the weekend and wanted something affordable. Great location, not to far from most places to visit. The plus side is there was free parking unlike most hotels in the LA area. Nice room and pretty good view.

ReviewText:Unfortunately they gave me a smoking room. I've asked for a different room but the hotel was completely booked. It looks like one of the room they usually use for the staff and they gave out only because they were out of rooms. The room smelt of smoke a lot and also the bed. -newline- We asked 3 times for some spray to refresh the room before someone came to our room. -newline- The smell on the bed was bad. -newline- Probably we were unlucky but the front desk staff were really unpleasant.

ReviewText:This hotel was perfect for our 4-night stay! It included parking and free wifi connection which was important to us because other hotels would charge for parking per day as well as for Internet connection. I also liked how this hotel was surrounded by the views of the mountains and how it sits in the downtown area of the city of Burbank. The staff was nice and was able to accomodate to our needs efficiently. Overall, I would recommend this hotel and possibly choose it for our future stay in Burbank, CA.

ReviewText:The room was very big, the bed was extremely comfortable. Room service was excellent. I got the filet mignon and it was perfectly good and wondeful quality of meat. We also ate breakfast in the restaraunt and it was wonderful as well. I have stayed at a couple of Holiday Inns and never have been really that pleased. This one blew them out of the water. The only things I'd change about it is it could use some slight updating and the 1st floor hall was cold and getting onto the elevators is very breezy when it's cold out. Other than that this place was very ideal and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
