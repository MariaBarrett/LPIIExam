ReviewText:This is a very nice hotel.  The prettiest Holiday Inn I've ever seen.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The hotel is within walking distance of several very nice restaurants and shopping, and is in a very cute, quaint neighborhood.

ReviewText:As a business traveler, this Holiday Inn covers most of what you need. You'll want to order in (the hotel food is bland and frequently overcooked), but the rooms are clean and comfortable, the building quiet, and it's ideally located for business in Burbank. The view on the upper floors is quite beautiful, as well. The workout facility is extremely small, however, so keep in mind you may have to compete for the treadmill.

ReviewText:Easy to find, close to the freeway and well situated in an area with lots of restaurants and shopping, this hotel has a business center that makes it easy to communicate with the office or clients. The decor was surprisingly pleasant and charming. As a business hotel you wouldn't think the decor would have been quite so nice. Even though I didn't have the opportunity to use them, it was nice to know that there is a fitness center and a pool available to guests.

ReviewText:The hotel was clean, quiet, and everyone was friendly.  The location was great - convenient to shopping, restaurants, and freeway. The room had free WiFi, a big screen TV, and a refrigerator.  The only thing to add is a microwave, especially for those of us staying for a full week or more. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Burbank area.
