ReviewText:Enjoyed the closeness to the airport as we were on the way out of country. The staff was very professional. Enjoyed the outdoor areas very much while waiting to take the shuttle back to the airport! Would stay there again.

ReviewText:It was a good place. Didn't have a problem at all. The only thing that needs improvement is the old TV and the air condition didn't work, which was okay because of the weather; I just opened the window.

ReviewText:We were looking for an inexpensive hotel for one night. This hotel was perfect! Carpet and wood a little worn looking but the bed was comfortable and the location easy to find. Parking is extra.

ReviewText:My experience was good. I was on the first floor which was very noisy. Then I moved up to the 9th floor which was way better. It was quiet and nice breeze through the windows

ReviewText:We arrived from Asia and very tired. The shuttle was at the airport within 5 minutes, checkin easy, rooms good, resturant on property that was good, Ralphs across the street if something forgotten, checkout easy and at 4:30 am the shuttle was ready to take us back to the airport. Great for what we wanted. Have do idea what was close by for a longer stay. Surprised us as how big the hotel was.

ReviewText:I return to Hacienda again and again. Best value in LAX area, and not a bad drive into most of LA. The pool and large jacuzzi are a nice plus. My only wish is for a coffee maker in the room. Must go down to street level to get coffee, but there is a starbucks & other coffee shops across the street, or the hotel cafe.
