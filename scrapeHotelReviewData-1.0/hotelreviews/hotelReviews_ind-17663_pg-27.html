ReviewText:Picked this hotel for it's location and it delivered. Centrally located to Hollywood, Burbank, Studio City, and Beverly Hills. Hotel was clean and mostly quiet. Very easy access to Interstate 405 and the 101. Outside access to most rooms and plentiful parking...a rarity in the L.A. area..

ReviewText:the purpose of this visit which had to be rescheduled was for a surgery.  There was considerable confusion with the date/time of the surgery thus the reason for having to reschedule.  We were immensely pleased with [...] the Best Western to work this out so we wouldn't be charged again.

ReviewText:Over all stay was OK but they like to hold on to the -newline- credit card deposit forever it,s been 6 days and still is not back on my account.And they should have in plain sight that they are going to take money off of your credit card and it may take a week or longer to go back on.

ReviewText:Our assigned room was not available upon check-in, housekeeping was still cleaning it.  The office immediately re-assigned us an upgrade with complimentary breakfasts at the on-site Denny's. Very nice staff. Rooms are dated, but very clean, updated appliances, comfortable beds and pillows. They are remodeling but we didn't notice.

ReviewText:The room was huge and the bed was so comfortable. When I first got there the remote wasn't working but within five minutes of calling maintenance was there with new batteries.

The pool and hot tub are clean but in separate locations. The staff was friendly and helpful.The motel is located in a conveint location with easy access to the 405 and 101 highways.Overall we enjoyed our 2 night stay here and the pricing we got thru [...].

ReviewText:The staff was friendly. No problems with late check in and check out. Got a room with two queen beds..very roomy. The decor is outdated. The mini fridge was a great size and two sinks in the bathroom. Couldn't hear the freeway. Plenty of parking and security cameras. -newline-  -newline- The hotel was better than I thought. Will stay again.

ReviewText:The hotel roomed smelled like a motel 6 and looked like a motel 6. The furniture was super old, worn and torn, and the carpet was discusting looking  (definitely not to be touched with bare feet). It really is not worth the extra money, just stay at a Motel 6, you will get the same thing, minus the coffee maker and who knows how old coffee!
