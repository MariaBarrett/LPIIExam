ReviewText:It was almost comic how many problems there were. -newline- The funniest was the elevator doors that took 20-30 seconds to open and shut.  I was on the eighth floor and went down the stairs twice.  The staff were helpful and courteous and the room was quite comfortable and clean.  It was hard to find a place to park to checkin.  There were cabs in the front area just sitting there.  The parking lot was full despite having the tiniest spaces imaginable.

ReviewText:Bone weary, after a flight from Beijing, I was able to sleep comfortably during my 12 hour layover in LA.  The wi-fi, room service and feeling of safety contributed to my good rest.

ReviewText:The hotel staff were not helpful in guiding us to our room as this is an old, large hotel with different buildings and was confusing.  Our phone did not work and we had to park on the street instead of the off street parking we had paid for.

ReviewText:The Hacienda Hotel Los Angeles very good.  Try the Enchilada's at the restaurant there to die for.  Being my first time in the USA was very daunting, and the staff at the Hacienda were very understanding with international visitor's. Keep up the good work mate! -newline-  -newline- Regards, -newline- Allan

ReviewText:I stayed at the Hacienda (South Tower) for three nights to attend a wedding.  I was happy to see that there was a restaurant (Mariposa's) on site and that there was a very charming patio area.  The personnel were friendly and kind.  I was at the hotel only to sleep, however, because I spent the days with relatives at a home in Westchester, CA.  Unfortunately, the air conditioner was loud and did not cool very well.  I was grateful that it was a cool weekend weatherwise, but the room was uncomfortably warm for me.  In addition, the window did not open (probably locked for security reasons?), but some night air would have been wonderful.  The sink drain appeared to need a cleaning because it drained very slowly. I am a pretty low maintenance individual and I got along ok.  The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the location was great.  I would stay again if I was given a room where the air conditioner worked properly.
