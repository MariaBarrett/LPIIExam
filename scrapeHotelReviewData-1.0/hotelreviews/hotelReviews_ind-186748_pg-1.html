ReviewText:We stayed at the London for 5 days because I like the expanse of a suite. It was well furnished, modern and spacious. The included breakfast and internet were an amenity that many high end hotels fail to extend, but the London did a great job with these inclusions.

ReviewText:We stay in one of the large suites. It was very nice and had everything we needed...A seating area, deck, wet bar...stocked to the gills, large soaking tub, large two head shower...fit two very comfortable and all the other great basic amenities!...we were happy with our accomidations. The London also had really good food...pricey a small burger is 21 dolllars and a glass of ok champs is 17 that was on the low side compared to the other champs. On to the negative! We thought the pool area was dirty and gross...it had out door grass carpet that was moldy and smelled. They had these large palm trees that blocked the sun and the chairs needed to be replaced ASAP! The actual pool was nice.London has a very nice hotel great service but the pool didn't match up at all.

ReviewText:The service was excellent where the valet, front desk and rooftop/pool service were concerned.  Service in The Gordon Ramsey restaurant for dinner was very good, especially the sommelier. -newline- The physical appearance of the hotel is showing signs of neglect: scratched furniture, soiled carpets, etc.The rooms are very large and comfortable.  One should avoid the San Vincente side of the hotel as it is very loud from all the traffic.

ReviewText:I was visiting family who live nearby so location was perfect.  It was nice to have coffee shops, boutiques and restaurants so close. -newline- I thought the inclusion of the breakfast bar was a very nice plus but when I asked about it at checkin there was no explanation.  What is included is just the breakfast bar.  All expresso drinks, egg dishes etc are all extra.  I would have liked this clarified on my reservation or check in. -newline- The room was well appointed, the bath was spectacular and the bed was comfortable.  The gym and pool area on the rooftop are very nice. -newline- Last time I visited family I stayed at the Mondrian.  It had in my opinion a more beautiful breakfast area near the gorgeous pool area.  However, the exercise room was just a room outfitted with equipment and the general -newline- feel of the hotel was more hip and noisy at night.
