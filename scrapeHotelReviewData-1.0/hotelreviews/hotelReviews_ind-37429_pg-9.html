ReviewText:Very enjoyable stay. Only issue, on first night of stay, the air-conditioning did not work, or was shut-off. Repair required two calls to front desk.

ReviewText:Very rude and unfriendly staff. On-site self parking is $16/day, but what they don't tell you is that you can park 2 blocks away for free. $12.95/day for in-room internet or free wifi in the lobby. Very nice precor fitness center. -newline-  -newline- This hotel is good for business travelers but probably not for families.

ReviewText:The Hilton in Los Angeles North/Glendale was very accomadating to my needs and as always the room was clean, comfortable and staff was exceptional. There is a free shuttle bus that takes you to a nearby mall as well. This is my second time staying here when in Glendale. This is by far the best hotel in this area dont stay anywhere else. The price is reasonable and would recommend this to anyone who is looking to stay in this area.

ReviewText:If you're jetting into Burbank, this is a good place to stay for the weekend. A more affordable steak dinner would've been welcome. Friendly staff. Good bed.
