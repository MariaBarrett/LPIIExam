ReviewText:My wife and I enjoy staying at the Hacienda very much. We have had to travel from Australia to LAX on a few occasions, and we love to stop for a day or so at the Hacienda to recuperate after a very long flight . The restaurant we particularly enjoy, as the food is excellent , service good, and prices are very reasonable.

ReviewText:The hotel is minutes from LAX and has more character than most airport hotels. Sunday night salsa night? What a bunch of unexpected fun. Prime rib in 24 cafe was predictably mediocre. Looked good on the menu and resto was clean and well-staffed. Overall, I really found this hotel very relaxing and convenient. Peace

ReviewText:Found hair on towel and the towels were sort of worn out. -newline- Socks from previous visitor hanging on the lamp . -newline- Candy wrappers on the floor. -newline- Worn TV remote: you could not see most key's labels (number's are easy to guess; not the rest) -newline- No cold water in bathroom's sink; once it got hot have no way to control the temperature. -newline- 3 stars is MISLEADING. At least the wake-up call came on time!

ReviewText:The hotel was fairly close to LAX and it has a free shuttle service which was great!! The bed was pretty uncomfortable and there was no in-room fridge which would have bothered me more if I was there for more than one night. The staff was really friendly and helpful, the resteraunt was pretty good, the bar was pretty good, and the overall style was worth the money for a near airport hotel.

ReviewText:We had a very short stay, but the beds were very comfy. The rooms are on the small side and the batherooms are very small, but the rooms were clean. The hotel is old and unique with 3 or so steps going up and down on the different floors. While unique, it is also difficult to carry luggage up and down. There is a great cafe attached to the hotel, as well as a barbeque restaurant. Close to LAX.

ReviewText:Checked in late, enjoyed delicious dinner at hotel's Carrasco's restaurant. Recommend the hot red chili enchiladas, chicken Caesar salad and cup of soup for the day. Elevator worked great -parking was very secure off Holly St., needs hotel room card key to get in and out of. Classic window style& clean, warm southwestern decor. Felt like we were in a classic Californian movie.Water/heat pressure worked fine for our room was 8 stories up. We'd definately go back to stay. Convenient location to airport ! The telephone push buttons were kaput but could call outside just not to front desk. Clock radio/alarm worked just fine. Classic, wonderful and beautiful. Lobby really cool.Reminded me of my childhood days when my mother took me up to L.A. I'd go back in a heartbeat. Thanks, George. Do you know the way to San Jose? Nice folks, clean and relaxing Mediterranean style patios. Bring your dancing shoes for their bar has a big dance floor and watched couples doing the cha cha and such. A very fun place for sure. Wish we spent more time there.

ReviewText:Large hotel, friendly reception staff and cleaners. Close to LAX, and shuttle service was fine. -newline- The room and hallway beginning to look a little tired. Beautiful courtyards, pool, etc. -newline- The breakfast was good, but service slow.

ReviewText:Parking was terrible (too far and not enough). The design of the hotel was rediculous, (it took two hours to find a route to the pool). Half of the elevators in the different buildings worked. The lobby and the courtyard had been remodeled in the last 15 years, but the hotel, halls, and rooms were looking worn from about 50-65 years of wear and tear. Finally, I really enjoyed being put on a floor with 100+ kids and no aminities at all. 1 1/2 stars maybe.
