ReviewText:This hotel describes itself as a 3 star. The exterior is beautiful. Rooms are absolutely the worst I have ever stayed in. Very dirty and a bad smell. I was upgraded to another room after I paid $426.00. It was not much better.

ReviewText:Very nice place; staff friendly; however, the room next door had a radio blasting from 10PM to 1AM and the staff did not know how to handle this situation.  As a result, we had a terrible night's sleep and will be taking up this issue with the management of the hotel.

ReviewText:Looks nice from the lobby and outside but then u get into your room and it's old, paper thin walls, small and not clean at all! I was there for bussinrss therefore I need my cell phone to be working which it ALWAYS has great reception except in this hotel for some reason. Called the front desk to tell them and they knew already that cell phones don't work there and told me if I stand on the street outside the hotel it should work! I'm like are you serious right now!? Then the staff were very rude unfriendly not helpful and condisending even the manager when I spoke with her to pay yo extend my room because I had more bussinrss. Also parking is rediculas at $28 a day! I would never stay here again! Way too pricey to be this aweful.

ReviewText:Initially upon check in, they have no record of reservation. After showing copies of reservation and waiting 25 mins., they come up with a room. Lug our luggage on a circuitous path, up stairs to our room. Room nice enough with convenient kitchenette. Absolutely worst part was NOISE from neighbors.Awake until after 3 am the first night with loud talking from one room and kept awake the third night until 4:30 am with partying and talking and people trying to get in our adjoining door from the other side. Walls so thin you could absolutely hear everything from adjoining rooms and made for very little rest. Therefore, I would recommend another hotel unless you are very hard of hearing.

ReviewText:The walls are extremely thin and guests can hear everything that happens in adjacent rooms.  The jacuzzi is kept at 80 degrees all the time- which makes it a small pool rather than a jacuzzi. The people who work at the hotel is friendly.  The daily rate for parking is outrageous.

ReviewText:My son and I were in LA looking at colleges.  The Beverly Hills Plaza was in a great location, easily accessible to all points of interest. The size of the hotel made it very nice to navigate and feel less like a tourist and more like a frequent visitor, I liked that.   The staff was friendly and courteous, but when I asked about a good Mexican restaurant in surrounding areas, they only knew about fast food places.  Also, could not use cell phone in room because apparently ATT is not accessible there. The daily $15 charge for internet usage seemed a bit much, especially when the server was so slow that at one point we got knocked off the internet and they had to sent the tech person over, at which point he lent me an old laptop that was barely alive.  To their credit though, the hotel did issue a refund. -newline- So, in conclusion, it was a lovely stay.  I would stay there again if I knew I could use my cell phone and had complimentary use of internet.
