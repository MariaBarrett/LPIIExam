ReviewText:The Millenium Biltmore is a grand dame of hotels. Not only is it beautiful, it's also spacious, well apointed, and welcoming.  The bed was really comfortable, and I had a good nights sleep.  The location was perfect---close to the airport and the buisness district.  This was the second time I stayed at the Biltmore, and it won't be the last.

ReviewText:The Los Angles Biltmore is an elegant, historic hotel with beautiful lobby (vaulted ceilings, dark woods etc) but rooms have recent remodel.    The room was large with a table/chairs, love seat, 2nd chair and two double beds and lots of open space. Usual tv, hair dryers etc     Food in the tea room is amazing with excellent service.   The hotel is located in downtown Los Angles within 3 blocks of the Contempory Museum, Disney Concert Hall, and Opera. Resturants and bar in the hotel are beautiful and very lively. Staff in all areas are very attentive. Enjoyed my stay and will stay there again.

ReviewText:We stayed two nights. Everything was awesome. The only negative was the parking! $40.00 a day! So we parked around the corner for 6.60 for the day and over night was 13 something.. def worth it.       Downtown area, not to shabby.

ReviewText:The Biltmore was a great place to stay, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful at all times, this made our stay much better and pleasant. The location is also superb, in the heart of downtown, we walked to the Walt Disney Concert Hall and to MOCA.

ReviewText:The Biltome is a charming hotel located in downtown Los Angeles. The location is alright, within walking distance of many amenities but as in many other office city centers, downtown LA dies out after dusk. The room was spacious and clean, even though the general look was faded. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. The gym was a fairly good fitness room with several aerobic and weight-lifting machines (although there were very few free weights). The parking fee (valet only) was pricey, $40 per night (parking lots nearby offer daily fees of $5-12).

ReviewText:The Millenium Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles stands as an historic, elegant, wonderful property in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. On first inspection the property appears in very good condition with much of it's original architectural elements preserved and maintained. The staff from parking valets to doormen to the front desk staff were friendly but reserved; almost business-like, could have been warmer in their greeting. The king room was pleasant, well furnished and comfortable but bathroom grout could have been cleaner. Unfortunately did not have a chance to sample any of the food or beverage. The parking charge for in-house guests of $40.00/day is outrageous and probably the reason I wouldn't stay at this property again.

ReviewText:The Biltmore Hotel lives up to its expectations.  Large clean room with a built in desk and cabinets.  Has 1 lounge chair with several floor lamps.  Beds are very comfortable with one nightable.  The bathroom rather small but comes with plenty of towels.   Midnight snacks are delicious.  One has to try the guacamole and salsa dip.

ReviewText:The Millennium Biltmore is located one block from the subway and is also convenient to major freeways. Hollywood is a short subway ride away. A quick drive gets you to Universal Studios. All the major attractions of LA area easily accessible.       The room I stayed in was remarkably roomy. When I made special requests they were fulfilled seemingly before I could put the phone down. Indeed, service at the Biltmore is consistently quick, friendly, and accurate. In short, if you like superb service; large, comfortable rooms; and an unbeatable location in a gorgeous Italian Renaissance hotel with an illustrious history (it's the original home of the Oscars) then the Millennium Biltmore is just what you're looking for.

ReviewText:Over all the hotel was good value for a nights stay but the rooms could stand some upgrading. We visited on a holiday and the hotel restaurant was more interested with outside customers with little attention to guests. The location was good and the staff very helpful. It is a place with a lot of history and well worth the stay.
