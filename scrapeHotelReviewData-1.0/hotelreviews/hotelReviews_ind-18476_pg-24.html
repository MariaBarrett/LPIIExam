ReviewText:The hotel was great and very clean, but there was a charge of $42 and $50. The 50 got removed (probably security deposit). So i called on the 42, and the manager said she would refund it to me (just a mess up), but she charged be ANOTHER $42, so on my card statements it says i owed them another $92 ontop of the hotel charge.... Soo

ReviewText:Thos place was a great deal. ..Close to LAX....great places to eat nearby.I met some really cool people that have been coming to this same hotel for years and we all agreed that the only drawback are the elevators (a little slow)....other than that, everything was great.I would come here again if my path in life takes me here.

ReviewText:Staff wasn't real helpful, had no amenities at all. We had to pay for everything. The room was very small and not very comfortable. Didn't even have a coffee pot in the room. Had to get the room key reset 3 times. It is in a very good location and plenty of restaurants within walking distance.

ReviewText:I was greeted with a professional smile and handed a clean room. I had a few meals at the restaurant, a drink at the bar, with food and staff well above average. Shuttle service to the nearby airport is free. Great buy for the price with restaurants and a grocer across the street.

ReviewText:If you are just looking for a quick stop before taking off or if you arrived late in the night at LAX,[ my case], then this is your place. I spend literally just the nights ( 2) not more thant ten hours, iin that hotel. But If you are looking just for a littel confort look for different place. I sleep ok almost on every surface but the bed and the pillos are not to confertable. for a comfortable two-night stay, try someone else. The bed was uncomfortable, the room was clean enough and the service was OK. $8 to park and there is free wifi. For the price, not really worth it.

ReviewText:I won't recommend this hotel. First, the parking is isolated from the hotel itself. There's not enough parking space for all their guests. There was an insect on my bed (although I think it's already dead since it was not moving). There was only one elevator working and it was too slow. The hotel staff, at least the one that I talked to when I checked in, was not so friendly. Overall, it's lesson learned for me. It was not a pleasant experience staying at this hotel. The only good thing about this hotel is that it is close to the airport. I almost forgot, the mattress is not even close to being comfortable.
