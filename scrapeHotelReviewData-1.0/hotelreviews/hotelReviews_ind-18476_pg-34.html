ReviewText:I travel to LA once a month and always stay at the Embassy Suites. This time they were booked and I ended up staying at the Hacienda for a higher rate. This hotel is in terrible condition, the elevators are a scary ride, they shake and make noices, the carpet in the hallways is literally coming off, the service is terrible exept for the shuttle service to the airport. I had to go to three different floors to find a working ice machine, the TV was so old that the picture was hardly viewable, I can go on and on. Avoid this hotel!

ReviewText:Room was nice and clean which is important, however, the hotel consisted of several individual buildings.  I stayed in the South building which wasn't staffed and was adjacent to a busy street and the hotel parking lot.  Building location and lack of staff made it feel unsafe to a single traveler.

ReviewText:We found the pickup at LAX to be slow. The check in had two desk clerks, so check in was slow. We had a breakfast voucher that did not show up on our reservation and we had a difficult time obtaining it. The room was nice the people were pleasant. Breakfast was good. -newline-  -newline- John Bower

ReviewText:My husband and I went to get away for a few nights during the week. It was a nice place the rooms were very comfortable and had everything we needed. The rest of the hotel looks very nice. It was raining so we did not get to go out to the pool or Jacuzzi. However we had a nice view of the garden and pool and enjoyed that.

ReviewText:Hotel room was decent and service was good.  Food at the cafeteria was average.  Only complaint is that room walls are too thin.  Housekeeping did not turn off alarm in vacant adjoining room and alarm went off for several minutes until hotel attendant turned it off.

ReviewText:This is an older, classic El Segundo hotel. Its not new and maybe on the "wrong side" of the LAX runways, but a great deal for the price. The lobby areas are colorfully decorated in Mexican colors, the rooms are clean and safe. They have 24/7 shuttles to LAX every 20 minutes and apparently are a popular stop for international travellers with an overnight at LAX. The coffee shop is 24/7 and good. The bar has dancing (swing, hustle, etc.) each night that provides some entertainment from a bar stool. I was just here for local business and declined to pay the price for a Century Blvd hotel. Scores are relative to the price and age.

ReviewText:Minutes from LAX and located near affordable resturants. No parking structure which can result in a long walk to your vehicle. Hotel has one Central air unit so you get either heating or A/C, you have no choice. Pros: clean, affordable, nice location, friendly staff, comfortable, shopping approx 3 miles south.  Cons: parking, the central air system.
