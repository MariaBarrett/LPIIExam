ReviewText:I was impressed with the hotel and staff. We enjoyed our stay. My concerns relate to charging for the internet and then not having the ability to access. The hotel staff did credit our account but I would like to have wireless provided free of charge. Also, parking was -newline- an issue. The hotel does not provide services for hearing impaired guests. There is no flashing lights for emergencies.

ReviewText:Spent 10 days there while in L.A. on business. Very convenient for a solitary business traveler (less so for families). Clean room. Hotel is very well situated if attending meetings in Century City, Hollywood, Santa Monica. Free parking across the street. Friendly staff. Beware the long stair climb -- no elevators beyond the second floor. So, if you can't climb stairs, this place is not for you. Otherwise, I would recommend it.

ReviewText:Very convenient for my business. -newline- What I hate is to have to pay $10 on the top of $260 for Internet. It should be complementary as coffee! -newline- Good restaurant but overpriced for the quality. -newline- The staff is efficient and nice.

ReviewText:Great location, nice little boutique hotel … a bit old but nice. Got a great rate (around $150 per night) but the problem is the daily parking and internet fees are high, which really increases your total room price … Other than these extra charges, good little hotel in wonderful location between Beverly Hills and Westwood/Santa Monica.

ReviewText:It seemed awesome. The entrance is really beautiful but the rooms weren't that great. -newline- There's an expensive area with nicer rooms and the rest are inn looking ones, not worth the money at all -newline- That staff wasn't very helpfull either and parking costs too much.

ReviewText:We booked this hotel very last minute, and the staff was very accommodating. We were upgraded in the room, which was nice, the pool was warm and inviting. It's close to downtown Beverly Hills so we took a taxi which the hotel arranged for us. Definitely recommend.

ReviewText:Helpful at the checking in counter, too many stairs to take the bags up and rooms very small especially bathroom, bed was exceptionally hard, kitchen was a bonus.

ReviewText:First time staying at the Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel, and was here for both business and pleasure. Two cab drivers that we had never heard of this hotel and both have been driving in BH for more than 13 yrs. each. The lobby was very nice, and the area surrounding the pool was excellent. Yet......we were stuck way out back where you need to take five flights of stairs to get to your room. This is after the elevator dumps you on the 2nd floor. The ceilings are thin and one can hear everything going on with the people above you, and we lost our AC our last night and had to suffer through the sticky night. Would not recommend for business.
