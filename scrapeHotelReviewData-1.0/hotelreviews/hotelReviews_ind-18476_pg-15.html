ReviewText:For the amount of money I paid I was expecting more. Plus the website i used, assumed I wanted two twin beds and didnt make it clear, so then there was that issue when i went to check in. I dont see why we have to go through big companies to book a hotel online. wish we could just go straight to the hotels website and still get a decent deal. No ice machine in my building, had to walk pretty far to get to one. dirty shower non slip thingy. didnt even want to use it but then i almost slipped so i had to! -newline- overall just an average hotel. people smoking right outside the door, and room service meal was not good at all, but they charged a bunch for that too!

ReviewText:Choosing this hotel was an excellent idea. The hotel was beautiful with flowers everywhere. I love flowers. It was clean and well presented. Definitely an A+ -newline-  -newline- The rooms were a bit too small for comfort but clean nevertheless. Would definitely come back. -newline-  -newline- The hotel is very close to the airport and beaches. Great choice for stay.
