ReviewText:My boyfriend and I decided to spend our three year anniversary here. -newline-  -newline- The amenities are all sleek, modern, contemporary and even fun! I thought the room was sheik and cozy. It was a little bit small but it did not hinder our satisfaction. -newline-  -newline- Service was friendly enough. And their rooftop bar / restaurant was small, yet glamorous. I will definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a getaway! The value was amazing! -newline-  -newline- Not to mention its close to Beverly Hills, the Grove and Koreatown!

ReviewText:Really convenient location, especially for Farmers' Market, LACMA and Beverly Hills. The rooftop is impressive (altho' the pool too small). Good food too... a great place to entertain friends/colleagues.
