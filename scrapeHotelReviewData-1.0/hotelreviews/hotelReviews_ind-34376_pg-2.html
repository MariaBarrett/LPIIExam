ReviewText:Staff was very personable and helpful. Great location in Old Town Pasadena. Close to lots of downtown restaurants and shops. Only two complaints about the room itself. The carpet was soaking wet! I understand carpet cleaning is necessary, but the carpet should be dry when you let allow a guest to stay there. I stood on a clean towel and noticed it was black the next day. I tried to turn on the heat to dry the carpet, but it immediately smelled like something was burning. I was only in my room for 5 hours so I wasn't too inconvenienced.

ReviewText:The room was really pretty and the bed was super comfy with great pillows. The spa & pool were nice and the staff were all very outgoing & personable. The only downfalls were the bathroom vent on the wall was filthy & there were several black hairs in the bathroom/vanity areas.

ReviewText:Everything was great, except we're used to getting free parking and, at least, a continental breakfast. You'll pay for both. $15 a day for parking is a hefty add on.

ReviewText:Employees were very helpful and courteous. Workout room was pretty spare. Room was very clean. Bed was comfortable, but the pillows are too full. I am a tummy sleeper and had to try and sleep without a pillow. Great location near old town Pasadena, close to shopping and awesome restaurants.

ReviewText:My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles/old Town. The hotel is conveniently located in walking distance to numerous excellent restaurants. The room was large enough to accommodate all the amenities to make our stay comfortable. Our room was furnished with a loveseat, microwave, refrigerator and desk area. -newline- The staff was professional and cordial. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable.
