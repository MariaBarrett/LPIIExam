ReviewText:Due to my job i get a high level of stress. The way the rooms are set from the amazing views to the super soft beds, helped me relax and enjoy my sleep. The hotel as well as the staff were great.

ReviewText:The hotel worked perfectly. We just needed a clean place to stay that accepts dogs and is well located. $75 is a little steep for pet fee, but the place was nice and room service was better than most in this price range.

ReviewText:I spent the business week at the Hilton--second or third visit. Staff are outstanding in helping with accommodations. This is a quiet hotel and easy to work on site. WI-FI available in a nicely appointed lobby and bar area. WI-FI in rooms at cost if you aren't an Honors member. Conveniently located near the Convention Center and within walking distance of Old Pasedena. Plenty of dining and shopping choices within walking distance. On site breakfast and lunch dining. On site pool and exercise room. Easy transportation via shuttle from and to LAX for those who don't want or need a car during the stay. Good value in my opinion.

ReviewText:We enjoyed our time at the Hilton. It was convenient to the race expo and 2.5 miles from the start line. The hotel was clean and quiet, and the staff, friendly. Would stay again!

ReviewText:My husband and I traveled to Pasadena for the Rock n Roll Half Marathon. The hotel was within walking distance of the expo (one block). It was approximately 2.5 miles from the start line, an easy and quick drive making the location perfect. There is a mall with lots of shopping and restaurants with in a few blocks. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff very friendly and helpful. The pool was heated and we enjoyed the jacuzzi pre-race. The only minus we experienced was that the walls were thin and we could hear the conversation in the next room, but it was not bothersome.
