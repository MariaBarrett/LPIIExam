ReviewText:I went as a little working getaway during a hot weekend. So when the desk chair in the room was broken I wasn't too happy. When the iron didn't work, I was pretty miffed. And when the AC went out, I wondered why the room cost so much.

ReviewText:We moved to this hotel after a disappointing night a mile away. We came in for a show at the Staples Center, so this location was perfect for us. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. However, the wait staff at the patio restaurant was disappointing. I had to go and get my own drinks/food from the bar as no one bothered to wait on me. It was kinda strange. Food was good and it was lovely to sit out there in the evening. The room was clean and modern. Although In the morning we could hear every word of our neighbors convo, so the walls were quite thin. The bed was really comfy, so we had a restful nights sleep. Valet was responsive but be aware parking was $40/night. Overall a good stay for us.

ReviewText:when we first arrived, we pulled up to valet. I expected $20 , it was $40. That is really high to me. As a hotel guest, we should of got a little break. When we proceeded to enter the hotel, the appearance was great. Looked nice and clean. Upon arrival at the desk, the man wasn't so thrilled we were there. Just blah service. He also was a little rude when my fiance asked a question. A little snappy. With a high traffic, prime location hotel, you would think you would want top notch service. They allowed us to check in 40 min early, but the second room wasnt ready, no biggie. The staff that was cleaning the rooms were nicer than the man Steve up front. I am very big on customer service, and this location lacked this. Other than that, a little too pricey, but great location. If the service was over the top I wouldnt mind paying the $.

ReviewText:This hotel is very nice, clean and the Staff are professional. It's located next to restaurants, clubs and attractions. I really enjoyed my stay. -newline- The only issue I had was that the air conditioning did not cool to MY specifications. Most likely okay for the average person. -newline- I will definitely return to this hotel.

ReviewText:Decided to try out this hotel because of the proximity to the staples center and local eateries. The location was perfect, staff was friendly, and the hotel was very clean. The only downside was parking, there is no self parking only valet and the cost is $40 a night.
