ReviewText:Hotel is in an excellent location both for walking to Rodeo Dr. and for accessing Hollywood and other tourist spots. Rooms are about average size but clean. The maid service was good but not great as they left some trash and forgot to leave the same amount of towels for the room. I'm upset that we booked the room 9 months prior to use and our room was the farthest from the elevator. Parking fees were outrageous costing $28.00 per day. Would I stay there again? Yes.

ReviewText:Re the hotel , -newline- The front man at hotel registration was unable to give me enrollment in the Hilton rewards program and give me frequent flyer credit . He asked me to email him my frequent flyer number from SWest Airlines, even after I gave him my card issued by SWest Airlines.He said it was wrong. -newline- I was charged for 2 nights of parking . I explained to the clerk at checkout I had no car. He then agreed to remove the 2 charges of $34.00 each. -newline- I asked on Saturday to be given a complimentary coffee setup for the room. It never arrived. -newline- The room was fine , I enjoyed the quiet and the atmosphere , and the staff was nice.

ReviewText:It was a nice stay overall.  The hotel staff are very helpful and nice.  One of the guests took my newspaper that was delivered in the morning but that was a minor disappointment.

ReviewText:We booked a junior suite through Orbitz.  A friend recommended we make sure we stay in the newer portion of the hotel (she said it was nicer and had a balcony), and we inquired when we arrived.  We were informed that our reserved junior suite was located in the old tower, and to switch to a junior suite in the new tower would be an additional $75/night.  We checked out the room, and while it was really nice (beautiful bathroom with deep tub & tv, large spacious room, large balcony), it had a poor layout, and looked out onto the hotel rooftop.  We opted for a standard room in the new tower, which  cost an additional $35 a night over our reservation price.  The room was nice, if a little small, with a modern bathroom (no bathtub, unfortunately), a decent size balcony with views of the hills, and a very comfortable bed.  The room was tastefully furnished, clean and modern. -newline-  -newline- The most frustrating aspect of staying at the Beverly Hilton was the fees and expenses.  Parking was $34/night for valet service (which was prompt and offered good service), $10/day for internet access (not particularly fast), and the items in the room's stocked fridge were ridiculously expensive.  $6.50 for a 12 oz bottle of water!  Worse, the fridge is pressure sensitive, so it charges you for anything you move--which makes the in room fridge worthless for keeping your own items cool.  The hotel was willing to pull the items out and make some room upon request, but required a $20 "restocking" fee. -newline-  -newline- This is not an inexpensive place to stay.  Room service was ridiculously expensive ($20 for a continental breakfast), and poolside cocktails were $14.  That said, the service at the hotel was very good, the location is excellent, and the hotel is pretty swank. -newline-  -newline- The extra fee for staying in the newer part of the hotel was a little frustrating.  We pointed out that we had already paid for a junior suite, so moving to a standard room in the new tower shouldn't incur additional expenses.  We were told the hotel's policy was to charge for upgrades to the newer tower for customers who book through travel sites.  He seemed to suggest that regardless of the type of room booked online, the hotel would charge the same upgrade fee: $35 to a standard room/$75 to a junior suite.  I was left with the impression that had we booked a standard room (instead of the junior suite), we still would have paid the same upgrade fee. -newline-  -newline- Although the hotel insisted on applying the upgrade charge, they did waive our entire parking fees, which was essentially the same amount. -newline-  -newline- In sum, we enjoyed our stay at this beautiful and historic hotel.  It isn't cheap, but offers a high level of service, beautiful rooms, and an overall good experience. -newline-  -newline- Pros: Good service, historic hotel, beautiful lobby, good location, really awesome pool. -newline-  -newline- Cons: Lots of additional fees, expenses and surcharges.

ReviewText:I expected a little more of the rooms given the pricing, lobby decor and pool. They were very nice but not FABULOUS. The beds were very comfortable. I had a regular room, I'm sure the suites were much better! Pool area was gorgeous. Unfortunately when I was there it was too cool to go swimming but I would go again just for a chance to swim and lounge in the pool area!

ReviewText:The valet parking service was very friendly, brought you your car with 2 bottles of cold water every time you went out. -newline- Concierge was super, friendly and helpful every time. -newline- The lobby is fantastic with a huge tropical fish tank, tropical birds in cages and lots of plush seating areas. -newline- Trader Vic's lounge was decorated really funky.  Had indoor and outdoor seating by the pool. -newline- The pool area is like a movie star's paradise with gorgeous seating areas and tent topped lounges. -newline- The gift shop is nice, expensive though. -newline- Our room was very nice.  Don't snack at the honor bar!  A little sleeve of Chocolate chip cookies was $10., a can of coke, $6.50.  Nice flat screen TV.  We were on the first floor so there was some traffic noise outside in the morning and a cement block wall outside our window. -newline- The location is great for walking to Sprinkle's cupcakes and Rodeo Drive.  I could afford a cupcake, though not even flip flops on Rodeo Drive...$995. -newline- Take the tour of the stars homes and ask if Richard is driving.  It's a van that picks you up at the hotel, sit in the front seat for excellent photos. -newline- I would definitely go back to The Beverly Hilton!!!

ReviewText:the Beverly Hilton has always been a beautiful hotel.  I use to live in the area, but had never stayed there.  I live out of the area now and needed to stay for 2 nights in the Beverly Hills area.  We were there for a medical procedure and needed an additional refrigerator for our own food and drink.  I didn't know that the hotel would be able accomodate us and they had it delivered right away.  Very friendly and thoughtful staff.
