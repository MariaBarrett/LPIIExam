ReviewText:A girlfriend and I stayed at the Biltmore for a weekend and we really enjoyed it. The rooms are large for an urban hotel and well maintained. Our room was through a door that led to two rooms, which was a little strange, but it wasn't a big deal. The pool in the basement was difficult to find, but was really neat once we located it. Just a great place to spend a weekend around the holidays.

ReviewText:We chose this hotel for it's history and location, despite several negative reviews about room condition and staff. I'm happy to say, in our experience, the rooms were great and staff were all friendly and hospitable. We really enjoyed being able to walk around downtown LA , which is having a resurgence, on the many guided and self-guided walking tours. -newline-  -newline- We would definitely choose this hotel again!

ReviewText:The hotel itself was beautiful. The room was clean and comfortable and personally I thought it was nicely decorated. The only problem with the room was the noise level outside, possibly because we were there during Christmas time, which was just a bit above my comfort level. The gym equipment was somewhat dated, but my biggest issue was that the gym had no windows to the outside. Staff was friendly, and the concierge very helpful - she gave us a map of the area and some interesting places to visit and helped us with transportation questions. Also, we got there before the check-it time and they offered us a different (but equivalent) room so that we could check in early. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.

ReviewText:The hotel was an average hotel (stained carpets, old scratched mirrors) The Bed was VERY uncomfortable. The matress had waves in it , very worn, very old. -newline- Staff was very nice. But I upgraded the room due to free internet access and at the end of my stay I got charged 9.95 per night and was told all Orb itz customers do not get free internet service.
