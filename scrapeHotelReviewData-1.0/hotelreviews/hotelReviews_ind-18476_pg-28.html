ReviewText:I was very pleased that I could check in early (1:40 p.m.) and the room was ready. The room was very clean and elegantly furnished (plus nice pictures on the walls). The hotel lobby was beautiful and the desk staff was very helpful. I have stayed at the Hacienda several times over the last few years and it has always been a pleasureable experience. The only thing I would like to see is a coffee maker in the room. Other than that, I couldn't ask for anything more. It's a great hotel for someone who needs to be close to LAX and needs a shuttle bus. I will stay there again.

ReviewText:Even though we had prepaid everything, clerk would not find our reservation. Only after I opened my computer, he believed us, but still found nothing in his records. Rooms are quite far from lobby, at second tower. Bed was comfortable, and romm was clean. Check out was quick and shuttle service efficient. I am still puzzled about a US$50 charge thrown into my credit card, by hotel, and waiting to see it canceled.

ReviewText:Aside from the location, close to LA and close to Redondo Beach, I found the hotel staff not very accommodating, the room cleansiness somewhat below average, and the noise way too much. -newline- The towels had stains, the hotel seemed to have been renovated, but many things still point to its age. -newline- If you want to sleep in, good luck! The noise outside can be somewhat blocked or overlooked and I'm sure it'snot permenant, but the slamming of the room doors on the floor was horrible. Every time a door slammed, the whole room shook. -newline- I should probably also mention that I got what may seem to be a mis-dialed wake up call at around 4 am one morning. Yeah, not really what I bargained for. For the price I was paying, my friend stayed at the Westin and his room was really nice.

ReviewText:close to airport, but the room is creepy. Don't feel very well with the bed. I need to call staff to fix the faucet so I can take a shower. Overall, not a good experience.

ReviewText:Hi, -newline- I fly into LA a few times a year and usually stay at the LAX Travel Lodge. I decided to try something different this time. The Hacienda was $10.00 more expensive. -newline- They have no overnight luggage storage. The room was tiny and old . The plug on the tub did not work and the toliet ran all night. I would not go there again. The Travel Lodge was much better and $10.00 less.

ReviewText:We had a pleasant stay at the Hacienda Hotel. We had a comfortable room and the location is conveniently close to LAX and the freeway. It is a great value, and we would definitely stay here again.
