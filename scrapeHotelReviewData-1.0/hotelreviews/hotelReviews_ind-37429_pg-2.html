ReviewText:Ordinarily, I would give this hotel perfect ratings. I have stayed here many times while visiting Glendale. It has always been my hotel of choice there. -newline- This stay, when I reported that my coffee maker would not function, the staff immediately set a replacement in the works so that I would have it the next morning. However, they did not offer me complimentary coffee in the hotel restaurant. -newline- I was also quite inconvenienced by the self parking situation. Each time I attempted to enter the parking structure, my ticket would not work, necessitating my contact with the front desk. Frankly, I got tired of waiting in line there so many times to validate my parking. I was not offered any complimentary parking for the inconvenience, until I asked for it. Then I was credited with one day's parking. -newline- Other than those two minor problems, I am satisfied with my hotel stay in Glendale.

ReviewText:The room was tiny and the layout uncomfortable. The only chair in the room was 2' from the TV (and no other space to move it to) so it wasn't usable for sitting watching TV. The bed also did not face the TV. After a long day/evening out it was tough to come back and relax. It did have a nice window seat but the desk was placed in front of it. The bathroom did not have a magnified mirror - something that is standard at other hotels. Location has road noise even in the upper floors. There is a $19/night parking fee.The good news - it was clean and has a nice public space (although busy with events).

ReviewText:The hotel was very conveniently located to where I needed to be for meetings. It was a very nice property with a lovely mountain view, and underground , safe parking. The staff was wonderful. -newline- The daily price for internet is a bit high in my opinion.

ReviewText:I requested a room big enough for 4 people and got a room with a double bed with one desk and chair. -newline- Bathroom was very dated. The shower was barely flowing water. I requested more towels and got the standard. The room temperature was not responding to thermostat and a repair man came to fix it. The refrigerator was unavailable due to broken handle. -newline- Pool was totally abandoned. No towel service. They told us to get it ourselves from the nearby fitness room -newline- The complimentary breakfast was very good. Yikes, no wonder the Hilton girls need to do reality shows to make a living!

ReviewText:The hotel was professional, attentive to all requests. The room was large, clean, and very comfortable beds. The bar area was gorgeous with beautiful view at night and day. The pool area was bland - could use some greenery and ambiance. The location was convenient off the highways, but nothing to walk to. The town of Glendale is 1 mile away and the Americana Mall area was beautiful. My major complaint is paying $18 a day to self-park. I think parking should be included or not more than $10 a day maximum.

ReviewText:We were here for the weekend and had a car to drive. Pretty close to Hollywood/Universal by the highway. Overall the hotel was of average quality (feels like a 3 star), and the staff were very nice. Would recommend for 3 star price.
