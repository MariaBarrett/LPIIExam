ReviewText:On the positive side: We were in town for a  wedding, and this hotel was close to all events. which was very important to us.  The pool is nice and there was a spa hot tub right outside our room.  the rooms are quiet and clean.  The valet parking was easy to use and the drivers were always courteous, helpful, and friendly.  On the other hand ... not so much with the front desk workers (although one young lady was very nice) - these people tended to be rude and somewhat snobby-acting.  The fees for internet service were not explained and it is very easy to just log-in without knowing you're being charged.  Bathrooms are very small and cramped.

ReviewText:My husband and I stayed the night befoe he had to go in to a local hospital for surgery.    When I checked in they noted that I pre-paid with orbitz and therefore I didn't get the best room location. I stayed on a few extra nights.  Room was adaquate, however there was no elevator up to the floor that we were on.  The bathroom was extremely small and the lighting was poor.  Other than that the room was clean and the staff was friendly.  The hotel was re-doing the front entrance to the hotel so you have to be careful going in.  Also parking was $20 a night, but some the hotels I checked was more.  Also, I was missing an article of clothing when I packed to leave.  I asked the front desk to check with housekeeping, they coould not seem to find it.

ReviewText:The Beverly Hills Plaza is very nice hotel for the price and locaation. Most of the service was good. The major issue is with the comfort of the bed. The bed matress is the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on. It was extemely hard and appears to be very old. In addition, they need to replace the two small pillows they provide for sleeping and a very outdated comforter.

ReviewText:I was very impressed with the accommodations. We had a one-bedroom suite with a full kitchen and dining area at an excellent price. I brought my grandson to see UCLA and go to a football game. The hotel is very close to Westwood. My only negative comment is the TV reception was not great and when we tried to watch a pay-per-view movie the system was not available.

ReviewText:The hotel is undergoing renovations. We were not aware of this. When we arrived there were construction trucks parked in the front blocking easy access. Also, the resteraunt was closed and the only eating facility was a small temporary resteraunt with five small tables. It was the same kitchen used for room service with a limited menu. The resteraunt closed at 9:00p. Additionally, you were not walking distance to anything.

ReviewText:The grounds of the hotel are very attractive and the rooms are spacious with kitchenettes.      Unfortunately, the rooms are also dated and not very comfortable.        -  No desk to work at.  I had to drag a chair from the sitting room into the bedroom so I could use the bed side table as a desk.   -  Bed spread looks like it was purchased in 1957, and washed at least twice since then   -  Bedroom was small compared to a large sitting room, and was poorly furnished   -  Old, small TV set.   -  Crazy quilt of stairs leading to the room. You have to go up and down and up and around, and then back down again.  Quaint and lovely, but a real pain in the butt with luggage.   -  The hotel lobby is being renovated, and the main restaurant is closed.  They've moved 10 small tables into the bar, and that's it.  The food was good (spinach was excellent), but the bar tender / waiter keeps the TV on and turned up load, so it's no place to talk or relax.  There is a seeminly nice dining area just outside the bar entrance, but the contractor's trucks are parked literally 4 feet away, and have generators running and exhaust fumes make dining outside impossible.  And of course you're right on Wilshire, so traffic is going to be loud and constant.   -  Forgot about nearby dining options.  There aren't any.  You're in the heart of a residential district, and have to drive everywhere. The best thing about my stay was the limo service to downtown LA.  Outstanding value, and the limo driver was worth putting up with all the other problems.  I'll probably stay here again just because of that.
