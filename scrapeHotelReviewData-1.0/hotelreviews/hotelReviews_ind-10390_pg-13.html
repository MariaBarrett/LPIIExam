ReviewText:This beautiful and historic hotel has a gorgeous lobby and lower level meeting rooms, but once one enters the elevator and ascends to their room, the charm of yesteryear soon fades away. -newline-  -newline- I should have known I was in trouble when I left the elevator and found the corridor carpet was held together with red duct tape, but I kept my spirits high until I reached my room. Large but Spartan, the room could have still met my needs had it been in good repair. However, in my particular room, I had peeling paint on the bathroom walls, a tub that had chips and gouges to the enamel, a noisy and dirty heating unit and an absolutely disgusting old single service coffee pot. -newline-  -newline- When you add to this to the TV with a volume control that could not be turned lower than a preset volume, lack of free Wi-Fi in the room and no continental breakfast included with the room stay, I would have to say this was one of the worst hotel experiences I have had. If I were staying in some fleabag joint on the side of the highway, I would have expected such amenities, but what makes this all that more disappointing is that this was once the height of luxury. What a shame.

ReviewText:Lobby and other common areas are exquisite, but my room was looking a little worn around the edges. Tears in the carpeting in the hallway were covered over with ugly tape.

ReviewText:We've never been to L.A before and we could have stayed at a hotel near the airport, but we're glad we stayed at the The Millenium Biltmore Hotel which is near everything at a reasonable price. Across the street was the Pesrhing Station that took us to different attractions and restaurants. The only thing that my wife did not like was the costly use of the internet.

ReviewText:The hotel was very nice and the staff were lovely. The room, however, was very tired. Not only did the curtains come off the wall upon trying to open them in the morning, but i swamped the bathroom when I took a shower. The showerhead was just as tired as the curtain rod and poured water in all directions, much like my sprinklers at home.

ReviewText:The decorations of the public rooms and ballrooms at this historic downtown LA hotel are irreplaceable. And this is where the first several Academy Awards ceremonies were held. I have attended events here, but this is the first time I've stayed in a room. -newline-  -newline- Now, the place was built in the 1920s, and I was in the old wing, so it's understandable that it was showing its age in places (the hallway carpets were patched, for example), but the room itself was spacious. The elevators were quick. The mattress was new. And most important for me - it was quiet! -newline-  -newline- I happened to be there when they were having a guest cocktail event (trying to get us to sign up for a loyalty program), which was a pleasant surprise. The manager gave me some tips on restaurants. My encounters with staff were all professional. -newline-  -newline- You need a car in L.A., and the hotel is located a couple of blocks from the 6th Street freeway entrance that takes you in all directions. -newline-  -newline- Speaking of cars, the worst part for me was the $40 daily parking fee, which I learned about after arriving. But that seems standard in L.A., so I just had to accept it.

ReviewText:Location was good, room was clean. My problem was with how thin the walls were- there were so many complaints and banging on the walls because you could even hear people speaking in the next room. Other than that, it's a pretty hotel.

ReviewText:It was a great experience to stay at this clasic hotel. I suggest to have beetter maintenance in the pool area, specially the jacussi, which was dirty and they used a wood board on a whole on a step to get to the jacussi. The sauna is in bad shape too.
