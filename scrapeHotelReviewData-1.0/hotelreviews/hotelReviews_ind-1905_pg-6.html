ReviewText:having stayed in motels for most of my trip i was sad that the hilton, as the most expensive by far, was the only one that charged for basic things like wifi access, parking etc. also the room wasn't as clean as some i'd seen in motels along the route. but it wasn't horrendous either, it was perfectly adequate.  and the location is excellent if you want to "do" hollywood - they have free shuttles to universal studios, and hollywood itself is very close by. if you want to see everything in hollywood the location couldn't be better. but i expected better from a megabucks chain like this.

ReviewText:It was an amazing evening.  Girls night out; dinner, drinks, Toby Keith Concert.  Checked in and my husband arranged with the concierge to have flowers delivered to my room prior to my arrival for our annivarsary.  My husband joined me after the concert and we spent an amazaing evening celebrating our anniversary. The staff at the Hotel and the quality of service is Phenomenal!  Can't wait for our date night again.  We are going back to the Universal Hilton!

ReviewText:Was in LA to visit family and the location was perfect.  The hotel staff was attentive and helpful, both while we were there and when I called a couple days later trying to locate a lost item.  The restaurant staff were particularly helpful, including packing up our prepaid continental breakfast on the day of departure so we could have it for the trip home. The price was great for a beautiful room with a view and breakfast.

ReviewText:hilton universal city is a very nice hotel. the location is perfect as a starting point for sightseeing and as we were attending the dodger-yankee baseball games it was very convenient to get to dodger stadium. we have stayed there before and liked it so we decided to return. all the staff was very friendly, pleasant and helpful.  some of the waitstaff even remembered us from last year and would ask how we were enjoying our stay and showed interest in our activities. the woman at the tour desk gave us a lot of help in selecting places to see. the tours were great and very informative. -newline- when i plan a return trip to california i will most likely stay at the hilton universal city.

ReviewText:Whenever I stay for business in Los Angeles, I look to stay at the Hilton Universal City.  It is centrally located for me in terms of my travel plans with clients.  It is also ideal for leisure travel with the City Walk and Universal Studios right onsite.  The staff are always warm, friendly and wonderful (my old friend, Alberto, has been with the wait staff at the Hilton's hotel restuarant ever since I can remember -- a testament to how much Hilton values quality people.)  The rooms are quite nice with plenty of amenities (fresh fruit and free bottled water each day are nice treats).  The price is a bit imposing at times, so I try to come during weekdays when rates are not quite so steep.  I highly recommend it.
