ReviewText:This was my first time stay at this marriott and I will definitely be going back. The rooms are very nice, and clean. The staff made a mistake on my bill and quickly fixed the bill without a hassle!

ReviewText:If you are looking to say somewhere other than downtown or on the beach this the place. Old Pasadena is wonderful. I loved the area and we where only about 15-20 min from downtown for all the great touristy things!

ReviewText:I rented a room for my mother to "get away" for a night for her birthday. She wanted to swim and sit in a jacuzzi. From the minute we entered the lobby, the hotel staff bent over backward to make her feel special. They gave her a coupon for a free breakfast the next morning, a "goody bag" with water and assorted snacks, and a small bottle of wine. They also let her check in early. It was first class service all the way, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !

ReviewText:Great for a local vacation. I live 20 min away and staying here with walking access to all the Old Town restaurants, bars and clubs made it feel like a San Diego trip, without the drive. Great staff and location. You can't beat the location and price.

ReviewText:In town for a game at the Rose Bowl and picked this hotel because of location. Turned out it is close to 'Old Town Pasadena' as well. Found great food and plenty to do while not at the game. Just across the street was a pick-up point for shuttles to the Rose Bowl. Couldn't have work out better.

ReviewText:My stay at this Marriott was great. We just wanted a quick getaway and this was perfect. Extremely affordable and within walking distance to just about anything you can think of. Room service was delicious and the front desk staff were really welcoming and friendly. I will definitely be staying at this Courtyard again.

ReviewText:Every aspect of the Marriott was perfect, including the room and location. My only frustration was that I had to pay to park and there was no travelers breakfast offered. There was a price tag on everything!
