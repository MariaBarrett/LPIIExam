ReviewText:The location is great, right next to dtla. For the price you pay, I think it was a good stay overall.

ReviewText:We knew we wanted this hotel. It was a last minute decision. Your website had the cheapest rate, we looked at 6 websites and the hotel website directly (which had the next cheapest rate). The place met all of our romantic expectations.

ReviewText:The Biltmore needs some TLC. Rooms are tired looking and common spaces feel cold. Looks like a lot of group business is keeping their weekend business up.

ReviewText:Lovely old hotel. Perfect location to enjoy downtown L.A. Staff couldn't have been nicer. The room was ordinary but the overall experience was excellent.

ReviewText:It's right in downtown, only a couple blocks from the MOCA museum and coffee and pastry places. The hotel itself seems very old and hard to keep clean, but the staff did an excellent job taking care of us and ended up upgrading our room and removing the room service charges because we didn't have the best time here. This hotel physically needs a lot of work, but the staff gets an A+.

ReviewText:This place is dusty and dank. When we arrived they told us there would be no hot water for the first 4+ hours of our stay. We didn't have the option of waiting for it to come on as we had a meeting and had to take COLD showers. There was no discount offered for this, just an apology. -newline-  -newline- Also, be warned. Parking at this place is $40 a night. You can park in the public lot across the street for less than that. -newline-  -newline- The elevators take FOREVER. We literally waiting 10 minutes on our last day there for the elevator to come, and when it did it was so full of people we couldn't get on, so had to wait another 4 minutes for a new one. -newline-  -newline- This is a really dated hotel, I would not recommend this place.

ReviewText:Bathroom had a good amount of mold. -newline- Shower arm broke when I tried to adjust it. -newline- 6 AM wake up calls that I did not order. -newline- Requested king room, instead got two queens in handicapped room. They wouldn't give me another room. -newline- No fridge in room. Ice not on every floor. -newline- Vending machine steals money. -newline- Room occupancy tax added $200 to my stay. I don't know what that is(probably not their issue, but still it was unclear about charges) -newline-  -newline- Really - do not stay here. It need a 20 million dollar room renovation to get anywhere near a Marriott. -newline-  -newline- Just go to the lobby bar, enjoy its beauty, then head to your hotel and rest well.

ReviewText:Beautiful hotel. Rooms are old and the beds need more blankets. I was cold almost the entire night even with the heater on. No safe in hotel room..
