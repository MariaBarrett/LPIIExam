ReviewText:Rooms are small. Bathroom/Showers are small. Staff is not friendly. Can not sleep at night because it is too noisy, walls are paper thin. Horrible experience

ReviewText:My girlfriend and I wanted to stay the night in hollywood for dinner and drinks. The Hotel is popular and is in the very good location. The room was small despite the"upgrade" we received. The AC or something stayed on the whole night even though I the thermostat off. I dont recommend staying here but I the pool and restaurants are nice to visit.

ReviewText:I loved everything about the hotel. It is great for young people. The clubs in the hotel are amazing, the pool is great and the location is to die for. The beds were comfy and the maid service was awesome. Not for families,

ReviewText:The Roosvelt Hotel has an excellent location, however is not the best hotel to bring your children. If you are a couple or with a group of friends this is the perfect hotel for you. The Tropicana Bar in the pool area has great drinks and the enviroment day and night is awesome. I will definitely go back to this Hotel next time I visit L.A.

ReviewText:I checked into the Studio King (approx 500 sq feet) on a Saturday around 3pm with ease.  The 10th floor (12 Total) room was clean and surprisingly well appointed logistically for only 500 sq ft.  There are 2 bathrooms (one with shower/tub and the other with shower only).  It was on the end of a hallway/corner and had a good view of the Tropicana Bar/pool.  The service was good but it felt forced and not done with too many smiles.  The lobby definitely makes you feel the Hollywood vibe around midnight to 1am.  We had a great time at the difficult to get into Teddy's and stumbled back to the room for an after party as did many others in our hallway but the noise is kept out once you are in the room.  My tip:  Walk across the street to Petes Coffee to grab a refreshing coffee drink before checking out, you will need it as you wait for valet which takes awhile.  I experienced some of the best service while at valet.

ReviewText:Outstanding location, beautiful common areas in the hotel. We booked a two double bed room and it was very snug.  Decor was very simplistic and not what we expected for the price we had paid.  But I guess we paid for being on Hollywood Boulevard and having the walk of fame outside our door.  That was awesome.  Would definitely stay there again because of location.

ReviewText:Our room (2 doubles) was very nice.  Beds very comfortable.  Really nice linens and down comforters.  Bathroom pretty small.  Hallways were painted black (not sure why).  Great burgers at 25 degree restaurant.  The pool closed early 3 of the 4 days we stayed for special events.  This is a happening night spot, so it gets a little noisy at night.

ReviewText:Reserved a room in the tower but got stuck in a poolside cabana.  DO NOT get a poolside cabana unless you want to party until 6 AM, and have no privacy.  We didn't really want to party like that so for us it was a huge negative.  Got about 3 hours of sleep due to tons of noise.  Had we been in the tower it probably would have been much better.  It IS a great place to have drinks at the bar/pool, just make sure to get  quiet room.
