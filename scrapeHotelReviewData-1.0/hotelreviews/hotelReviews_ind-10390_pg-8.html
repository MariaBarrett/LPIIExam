ReviewText:Was disappointed in the room. Paid for old and rundown, when I thought it would be extraordinary. Have paid that amount before for other hotels and was "blown away" by the accommodations. Not so much with this one.

ReviewText:Stayed as a business traveler, convention at convention center. The Biltmore is just gorgeous. Classic old style gem of a hotel with a staff that must have been trained by Disney. True professionals. Room was clean, quiet and very comfortable. I'd return in a heartbeat.

ReviewText:The hotel had a great gym and indoor pool. -newline- The room was clean, and the shower head was really nice. -newline-  -newline- The location is great, and parking at Pershing Square is much cheaper than the valet. -newline-  -newline- The only negative really was bed comfort was so-so.

ReviewText:Excellent service from the moment you arrive to the time we left. The vallet attendents, conciege, bar tenders and restaurant staff are all very curtious and friendly. Hotel is in great location, within 1 mile or where we needed to be. The hotel grounds and facilities were well kept and the history of the hotel added to the charm.

ReviewText:Hotel was nice and clean, and the service good. -newline- I was very surprised that a high class hotel like this, -newline- did not have neither a refrigerator nor a safe in the room. I have been in hundreds of hotels, and this was a first. I complained at the desk, and was told a refigerator in the room is $10 a day. I said no thank you. However 3 days later they installed a small refrig. and did not charge me. -newline- Another thing I did not like was, parking $40 a day.
