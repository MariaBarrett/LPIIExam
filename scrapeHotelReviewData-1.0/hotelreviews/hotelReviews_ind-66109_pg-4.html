ReviewText:Stayed here before and may again.  The rooms facing Beverly blvd are loud because the French doors do not seal and are not insulated glass.  Easy fix and they should do it.    Food is oustanding!

ReviewText:This is a great hotel - the only thing it has wrong with it - is that there is no self parking - you are locked into using their valet service - not only is that service expensive - but also very slow.

ReviewText:We stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed our stay very much. The location was great with much within walking distance. The hotel was very enjoyable although other than the internet service we didn't really use any other facility or amenity there. -newline- The only negative is that we were on our 1 year anniversary and I would have preferred a better view. We faced the Beverly Center Mall. The view of the hills would have been better.

ReviewText:While probably a bit on the pricey side, the location is wonderful if you want to be in the area of the Beverly Centre, Robertson Ave, Melrose (short walk or small cab fare), Rodeo Drive (small cab fare), The Grove and Farmers Market (small cab fare).  The free internet access and bag storage on final day is also refreshing when compared to other hotels I stayed in during the trip.  This was the second time I have stayed at this hotel, and returned mainly due to the location more then anything else.

ReviewText:Great location near many shopping options, including fantastic mall directly across the street.  Within walking distance of pretty, tree-lined  neighborhoods for safe walking excursions.  Excellent restaurants nearby, including locals' hangout, "Dominick's," for tasty Italian.  Will definately stay here again on my next trip to LA.

ReviewText:I had a perfectly lovely stay at the Sofitel.  My room was spotless and comfortable, great bathroom, fantastic service, convenient location.  Wouldn't have changed a thing, except that the traffic outside was loud even though I was on the 9th floor.  Nothing the hotel could do about that, though.  I highly recommend the Sofitel LA.

ReviewText:Great location, within walking distance to cafes and shops on Robertson, Melrose and 3rd St. Staff was very professional and helpful. Ask for rooms facing the "hill" not the street if you can.  They are very quiet, while the street facing Beverly Ctr is quite busy. If you're looking for a great pool, this is not it. Very small and not much space for lounge chairs, the hotel only has 10, which were typically taken. But everything else was great.

ReviewText:This was my second trip.  The first trip last year was great.  Since then, however, the general ambiance has declined.  I was given a room on the 4th floor above the front entrance.  Not a good location.  At about 10:45 p.m. I was awoken by the driving bass of the disco lounge right on the ground floor.  That's the Stone Rose.  It was a huge party and loud.  So I called the front desk and they moved me to a different room on the 5th floor and away from the Stone Rose.  I still could hear it but it was passable with ear plugs.  I think they really need to have a heart to heart with themselves to decide whether they're a hotel or a disco.  Clearly from the front desk staff's reaction my own experience is a common one.
