ReviewText:GREAT location - decent value but a bit long in the tooth. The hallway carpets are a bit worn and the rooms have seen better days. Don't get me wrong - they're clean and acceptable - but a bit like spending the night in your grandmothers OLD house.

ReviewText:1. I arrived at the hotel after a 14 hour flight and very tired, the air-conditioning unit in the room was louder than the airplane engines on the aircraft. -newline- 2. The bathroom was the size of a small 2 star hotel albeit, the shower was hot and water pressure great. -newline- 3. The telephone next to the bed did not operate/work. -newline- 4. I had breakfast vouchers (breakfast included in cost of stay). On check out I found one breakfast on my bill - I explained that I had vouchers and the reception removed the cost from the overall bill. And yet, three days after leaving the hotel, I find that the Hilton charged my Visa card for a breakfast. -newline- 5. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HILTON TO ANYONE and anyone I speak to about the trip will be told what a sub standard hotel it is considering what was once a very reputable hotel. -newline- 6. For anyone that does stay there, the breakfast is fantastic. -newline- 7. Check your bills on leaving and watch your credit card bills for anything the Hilton charges after leaving.

ReviewText:The Beverly Hilton is very nice; no question! The rooms are classy but not at the level of, say, the Beverly Wilshire, which is much more expensive. The room rates are excellent for Beverly Hills. -newline-  -newline- The gym is fairly nice with some free weights, but not outstanding.

ReviewText:Customer Service is excellent all around.We arrived earlier than check in time and asked for a room upgrade. Sylvia made it happen and we ended up with a corner suite w/ large wrap around balcony. Room hadnt been cleaned yet but the housekeeper on the floor stopped what she was doing and cleaned ours immediately while we went downstairs for lunch. We ate poolside & the food was excellent (both at lunch & also the breakfast buffet on Sunday. We used the courtesy car to go to Rodeo Drive. Driver Alex was very friendly. This hotel will definitely meet your expectations!

ReviewText:The hotel location is super, close to everything, safe area, we can walk around in the neighborhood, hotel provide ride to the West Field Mall, which is excellent idea and convenient, so we do not to worry about finding parking on our holiday. The hotel is very beautiful, but room is nice but a bit too small. But the maid service is not good, did not replace the used towel & rug after took away. The policy of the hotel not to remove the drinks in the refrigerator or will charge for cleaning, is far too much, because there is no space at all for guest to put anything in the refrigerator.
