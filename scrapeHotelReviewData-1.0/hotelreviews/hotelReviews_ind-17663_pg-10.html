ReviewText:Hotel is very conveniently located near the intersection of the 101 and 405 fwys and Ventura Blvd where there are loads of restaurants. Apart from the noise of the main roads/fwy and nearby fire station, it was a great bargain. Pool is nice, but it was heated ... and in near 100 degree temps, not very refreshing. Rooms are comfortable, wi-fi great, and staff is friendly and professional. -newline- Our initial booking was for 2 nights but we've extended our stay by several nights!

ReviewText:The staff was not friendly. They offered a dark room (located under part of the building) at first and after complaining, they gave us another dark room. Only after insisting again, they offered a room with more light from outside. -newline- They fool you on their website as they show rooms from the tower suites and not the rooms that you finally get. -newline- The parking is cleaned during the day with a lot of noise that goes on and on..... -newline- Beside these negative experiences, everything else is average what you can expect for such a price but I would not stay again there.

ReviewText:Pretty standard, 2 story motel. Pool. Denny's onsite. Vending machines. Within walking distance of 2 gas stations with convenience stores. Parking spaces are tight and in the central courtyard are somewhat hard to come by. Seems to be very popular.
