ReviewText:If you need a hotel just for 1 night,as we did,because of flights leaving LAX-the hotel was alright.All we wanted was a bed to sleep in.Old hotel,check in took a while,only 2 desk clerks working.Not in the best area of L.A.   But close to airport

ReviewText:The best thing about this hotel is the Stay and Park feature. If you stay at the hotel you can park your car for up to 7 days at the hotel.  All for around $150.   The rooms are very clean - bathrooms looked newly remodeled.  The fitness room is small but all equipment is newer and nice.  LOTS of restaurants in the hotel including a bar, Mexican restaraunt, and diner style eatery with great coffee and breakfasts.  Starbucks, a grocery store, Subway, El Pollo Loco, etc are across the street.   1 mile south of LAX so very convenient for travellers including a free shuttle to and from the hotel.   The hotel grounds look as though a Mexican has decorated the Queen Mary - that is the best way I can think to describe it!  It has a boat like feel with hacienda style!  Very clean and well maintained, but don't expect anything too fancy or prissy.   The rooms are standard looking, nothing fancy but nice, clean, and comfy.  On the small side, but not clausterphobic or anything.   Elevators are a tad slow and old fashioned and check in can be a total nightmare since the hotel seems to be a hot spot for big tour groups, seniors, airline crews, etc.  There was always a line out the door to check-in and the entry way at the front is constantly jammed.  Even with long line, we checked in in about 20 minutes and the staff at the front counter were civil.     We will definitely stay here again because of convenience, price, cleanliness and ameneties.   Recommended!

ReviewText:The Hacienda was a very nice hotel option for a weekend trip to LA. While not directly in the center of LA, touring the city was only a trip to the lobby away, via VIP Tours. Also, the location was close to the transit system, which was nice for a non-driving tourist, who is use to travling by public transportation. The only thing really missing from the standard room was a microwave and mini fridge. Overall a good stay.

ReviewText:Great for travellers in/out of LAX which is just a couple of miles away - some airline crew ( cargo pilots )stay here which gives you an idea!     Adjacent restaurant is 24 hrs, and serves a good breakfast. Rental car returns for most major rental companies is just a few blocks away.  Hotel is on SEPULVIDA ( US1) which runs under LAX and then miles further north to close to downtown LA, and then from the hotel southwards almost in a straight line to Redonda Beach ( 7 miles) then westwards to Long Beach.........so you're well situated to start a journey and/or find the hotel at night!   Really no reason to stay here except that its practical, room is standard.........there's no free parking - you have to pay $5.00 a night to park across the street in the (hotel?) parking, and there was on several occasions a long line to check in/out........one or two persons at the desk and about fifteen waiting in line, with mounds of baggage.......know what I mean?

ReviewText:The Hacienda was very convenient to LAX.  The bed and pillows were so comfortable I slept great.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is staying for a short period and needs a quick exit to the airport.  I would definately stay here again.

ReviewText:This hotel has shuttle from the airport every 30min 24 hours a day, across the street are supermarkets and dinning options near by, when you go to this hotel ask for the south tower , the rooms are much better, it is a great choice for the money.

ReviewText:It is old and in disrepair. . .the room itself is more like a one star.  The sheets had stains on them and the bed was hard as a rock with two small pillows.  The towel bar in the bath room was loose and fell on the floor when I put my towel back on it.  The anchors had come out of the sheet rock wall and it looked like it had been that way for awhile.  The attached soap dish on the bath tub was broken.  The bath room and the entire room looked like it had not been updated since the hotel was built (which looked like the 1950's).  The towels were the old, thin and skimpy type.  The room was probably fairly clean, it just gave you a creepy feeling like it was old and dirty.  Their free shuttle service to LAX was very good, which is about the only good thing I can say about this hotel.

ReviewText:Bonne chambre, calme avec une touche sympatique au niveau de la déco, serviettes en fleur, lit bien fait sinon joli patio et personnel assez acceuillant. -newline- Seul bémol un restaurant ou on vous demande d'attendre a l'entrée alors qu'il est vide et le personnel vous passe devant sans vous regarder pendant 25 minutes alors qu'il y a 30 personnes qui attendent pour manger et quand vous leur demandez quelque chose il ne vous répondent pas... non je ne le conseille pas et je ne suis pas le seul. -newline- il faut une heure en métro pour relier le centre ville pour 6 dollars

ReviewText:Bra standardhotell nära flygplatsen. Hotellets bussar kör kontinuerligt mellan hotellet och flygplatsen. Hela familjen uppskattade utomhuspoolen och den varma bubbelpoolen. Något slitet på sina ställen, men inget problem. Långsamma hissar. Trevlig innergård utomhus.
