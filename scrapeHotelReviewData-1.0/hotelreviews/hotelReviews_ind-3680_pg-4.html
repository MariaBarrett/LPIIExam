ReviewText:This hotel is not as modern as some of the other Hiltons I've stayed in, and that was evident in the bathroom with a hot water supply in the shower that varied between moderately and very hot without moving the controls! Occasionally, the walls felt a little thin too as sounds from rooms next door drifted into mine. -newline- However, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the pool was lovely,  and the in-room dining was delicious and attentively served.

ReviewText:The hotel was beautiful, all the employees were very friendly and most helpful.  The hotel shuttle was a great amenity, it would take you anywhere within 2 miles.  The buffet breakfast was out of this world.  This was the best trip we have taken so far and we've been traveling regularly for the past 18 years.

ReviewText:The bed and pillows were very comfortable, the towels nice and plush, and the shower was good.  However, the sink did not drain very well and the low-flow toilet did not exactly flush.  If one was not careful it would have been easy to make it overflow.  The passive ventilation for the bathroom did not work well, and the windows did not open, so a smell would sometimes pervade the room.  The entire hotel did not "feel" like a Hilton. -newline- My wife accidentally left a sweater in the dresser drawer.  She remembered about 10 PM on the check-out day and we immediately phoned the hotel.  They called back the next morning and said they could not find it.  I did not have any one's so I left the maid $5.  Apparently that person took the $5 and the sweater also.  Excellent location but I may look around a little more the next time we go to Pasadena.  The Cordon Bleau Culinary School is three blocks away.  They serve a three-course lunch (filet mignon, organic salmon and many more choices) for TEN DOLLARS!  Reservations are needed!

ReviewText:Overall our stay at this Hilton was a pleasant one. We checked in rather late in the evening but the valet and front desk clerk were all very attentive and friendly. The rooms are nicely furnished with a ginormous hd flat panel in the room. Everything was tidy, however there were signs of some water damage in the ceiling area of the bathtub that got repaired in somewhat of a shoddy manner. Other than that everything was good. Quick easy drive to the Rose Bowl.

ReviewText:Money has been put into fancying up the lobby, the ground floor restaurant, and the elevator areas. Don't expect to see any updated bathroom or room. The tile is from the 1980s and the ceiling is still the old acoustical popcorn type material. It's not what one expects from a Hilton.

ReviewText:Nice-looking exterior, but that's about it. Parking at the hotel is $15, the room cost a total of $150, and truth be told, it was worse than some Motel 6's I've stayed at. The toilet was clogged from the time I arrived, and when I left it wouldn't flush. The atmosphere and decor did not reflect the price. My advice: if you're gonna stay in Pasadena, get a motel for half the price of this place. It is certainly NOT worth the money.

ReviewText:We have stayed here many times.  While the public areas seem fresh, the rooms are in need of a face lift.  The lack of free internet is a nuisance.  If it weren't for the location and ability to earn Hilton HHonors points, we'd probably stay elsewhere next time.

ReviewText:I stayed one night for a conference and had a chance to walk around the area around the hotel. There are a lot of nice restaurants and shops nearby, the surrounding area was clean and safe, even at night.
