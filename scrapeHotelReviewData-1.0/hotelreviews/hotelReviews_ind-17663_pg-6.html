ReviewText:This BW was comfortable and well-located for our purposes. The room had everything we needed and all interactions with hotel staff were positive. We will stay here again.

ReviewText:Very impressed with the cleanliness and updated look; pleasant staff. A little noise, but not a big issue. I left two items in the room when I departed and they were there when I called back to retrieve them. My issue is that there had apparently been a fire earlier that day (could smell it when I walked around). They did not mention anything about it when I checked in, but when I got into my room there was no A/C, no TV channels, no internet and no hot water. I called the front desk and they said "they are working on all of those since the fire, and they should all be fixed SOON". The hot water was fixed by the time I showered in the morning, everything else was still not working. I believe they should have told me about all the issues and allowed me the option of a refund and going to another hotel, or discount to stay there.

ReviewText:Average hotel. I did not pay much, so I can't complain much either, but there was lots of street noise. The AC unit continuosly cycles on and off and can't be set to a fan only white noise setting to cover it up. Loud banging each evening that sounded like air in the pipes when water was running. I could not find the source of that noise. Annoying at midnight. The maids tap on the door (well before noon) to see if you need service even if the do not disturb sign is out. No breakfast provided, although Denny's next door gives a 10% discount. Affordable but not very restful.

ReviewText:The hotel was a standard motel until I opened the door to my room where it all changed. It had everything I required, it was very clean and modern. There was a slight noise from the local main roads but nothing to complain about. The staff were so helpful and every day was easy and comfortable. I had a wonderful stay and it couldn't have been better!

ReviewText:I travel to Van Nuys on business every couple of months and so far, the Best Western Carriage Inn is the hotel I tend to stay at more often than not. Rooms are always clean, staff is always helpful. Free Wi-Fi in the rooms. AC works. Safe. Free Parking. -newline-  -newline- Discount at the Denny's in the parking lot, though I've never used it. They also have a pool I've never used. But it looks decent. -newline-  -newline- Can hear some road noise from if you are in the end rooms.
