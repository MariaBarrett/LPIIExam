ReviewText:The Millenium Biltmore is a historic hotel with a wonderful ambience. The rooms were pretty standard, and the bathrooms were nice and spacious. However the view left much to be desired. My overall stay was very satisfing. The staff was helpful and friendly and the room service was the best. I would stay at the Biltmore again and would also recommended it to others.

ReviewText:While the following did not affect me, I was surprised that the area to the elevator was up two steps and was not handicapped access (i.e. no ramp).      Secondly, the parking in the hotel cost $40 a night, but I learned that immediately around the hotel were secured indoor lots which cost $10-$15 per night.  Over the course of a four or five day stay, especially when one is not always using his car, that can add up to a lot of extra money for nothing.      It also was surprised that the doorman rarely bother to open the doors to the hotel, often leaving guests (I among them on one or two occasions) to struggle with luggage and packages.      Finally, I was in a room where the sink basin in the bathroom was cracked, and there was a large blackened, enamel-stripped area by the drain in the tub.      The common areas of the hotel (e.g. the lobby) were stunningly beautiful, in the hotel is quite convenient for those with business in downtown LA.  All amenities (e.g. dining, gym) were upscale, and the Biltmore, of course, is one of the great historic buildings in LA.      As one might expect, the front desk staff was cognenial and helpful.

ReviewText:The Millennium Biltmore is a beautiful hotel with very grand baroque/art deco proportions. Truly one of the sights to be seen in L.A. all by itself. Great amenties, indoor pool is not too be missed, good restaurants in house, lovely lobby bar with live jazz in the evenings. I stayed in a standard double room, while on the smallish side it was very comfortable. Lots of closet space. Great Bellman. Not much goes on in  downtown in the evening but the hotel is very convenient to other parts of towm eg. Hollywood, West Hollywood, Melrose Beverly Hills.

ReviewText:The Biltmore was recommended to me by friends and lived up every expectation.  It is a beautiful hotel that is wonderfully opulent in design.  The rooms were well appointed and comfortable; the staff friendly and helpful.  It was fun to stay in this hotel that reminds one of the glamour of the early 20th century. Sadly there is not enough of interest yet in downtown LA. It was hard to find a place to eat at 8;00 PM on Friday except at the hotel. Be prepared to make full use of the efficient valet parking!

ReviewText:The Millenium Biltmore was gorgeous!  The rooms had a very historic feel to them, the beds were comfy and the room service burger was the best Ive ever had!  Upon request the concierge even printed us out directions to go get Pinks hot dogs the day we checked out.  I would definitely stay here again!

ReviewText:Staying at the Biltmore is a historic and amazingly pleasant experience! One can see its greatness in every little detail.      The rooms are very large and comfortable.      Everything about the hotel is just perfect, but I would like to make a special reference to the breakfast, where you can order eggs with truffles and a glass of champaign, and to the Gallery Bar, with perfectly prepared drinks by nice bartenders and a wonderful atmosphere.

ReviewText:The Millenium Biltmore was a disappointment.      Not a really welcoming stay.  I asked to be moved away from a large rooftop air conditioner, so they put me in a smaller, darker room.  Air conditioning in the room was noisy.  Only one restaurant operating on Sundays--and it was just OK.  Architecture of the place is wonderful.  But overall comfort mediocre.  Wouldn't stay there again.

ReviewText:The staff at the Millenium Biltmore LA is truly top notch! Most especially the valet parking. Even though parking was 32 dollars a day, I consider it well worth it. The hotel itself is a grand old dame, with architectural and decorative details from the early Hollywood glamour years. I felt highly respected and pampered the whole trip!
