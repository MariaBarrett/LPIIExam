ReviewText:The hotel lobby is beautiful and the location is good if you need to be downtown.  The price was great for the area.  The rooms weren't great.  There is no refrigerator.  The hairdryer was about 20 years old and took forever to dry my hair.  The staff is certainly not overly friendly or helpful.  For the price and location, it was a good deal though.

ReviewText:The public areas of the Biltmore are spectacular and do indeed evoke an earlier era of LA glamour. The room while clean was not at all as inspiring as the public areas of the hotel and the TV set was a joke.... The bathroom was very clean as well as VERY small. It was still worth the stay in order to be able to catch a glimpse of what was once considered one of the premiere hotels of LA. The location was perfect for anyone who wants to see downtown LA and be able to walk to various venues.

ReviewText:The Millennium Biltmore Hotel,in LOS ANGELES, CA   is in downtown LA but has easy in/out access to the freeways. The room was excellent with a pleasant desk/work area plus plenty of lamps for needed lighting. The lobby areas are beautiful and they, along with one of the door entrances, have been used in films. The only negative point was the ineptness of the concierge as we asked for help, directions, etc.

ReviewText:We enjoy staying at the Millenium Biltmore.  It is undeniably the real deal, architecturally grand and lovingly restored.  I don't mind the size of the small guest rooms (typical of historic hotels), but the bedding and furnishings are beginning to show signs of wear.  Also, the bathrooms could use a cabinet for toiletries and storage.  I would characterize the lobby and general areas of the hotel as 5-star, but the guest rooms are 3-star.  However, the excellent on-site restaurants and friendly, helpful staff more than make up for these minor complaints.

ReviewText:Es ist für den dürchschnitz Bürger zu teuer. Internet muss man Zahlen, parkieren/ Tag 40$ zuviel für Gäste. Super Fitness und kleiner Pool zum schwimmen, für Sportler sehr gut geeignet. Kein morgen,Mittag und Abendessen im Preis inbegriffen.

ReviewText:歴史あるホテルでその重厚さは感じたが、滞在が日曜、月曜だったことから -newline- ホテルも周辺も閑散としていて、ロケーションからビジネスには向くがレジャー志向には以外と不便と感じた。

ReviewText:malgré la classe internationale de cet hotel, j'ai regretté la poussière sur la moquette de la chambre ainsi que la baignoire qui n'est pas digne de ce nom !!!! -newline- l'hotel est en lui-même tout simplement sublime
