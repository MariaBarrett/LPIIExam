ReviewText:The hotel did not have wifi, had to pay to have it in the room, did not have parking, the only option was to hire a parking lot for 24 hours at 38 dollars. Not had breakfast. We asked for non-smoking room and they gave us one with cigarette smell. Maybe you can get something better for 210 dollars per night.

ReviewText:I got a great rate and this is not a bad hotel, but the room lacked personality. Also, the driveway was kind of a nightmare for pulling up your car / valet. Took forever and the staff did not move with any kind of urgency.

ReviewText:The hotel was perfectly located. However I think it is too expensive. I would not pay more than $200 dollars for a room.

ReviewText:The Loews Hollywood Hotel was in a perfect location to see all the sites in Hollywood. The Walk of Fame was right down the street and it was an easy drive over to Beverly Hills. The hotel was like a little oasis to get away from all the hustle and bustle of all the people on the streets. We got a Jr. Suite which was really big and it had these huge windows that over looked the Dolby Theater and a shopping mall. It had a sleeper sofa that my teenage daughter slept in. was fun to look out at everyone below. The king size bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was very well designed. The shower and toilet was separate from the sink and dressing area. The lobby of the hotel had a bar and Starbucks that was handy. Be careful with the in room mini bar. If you take something out there is a sensor that will automatically charge the item you took out on to your room. There are four spaces that you can use for your own drinks but don't mess with the other spaces or you will get charged for it. We really like the Loews and would for sure stay there again.

ReviewText:I'd recommend skipping COBO WABO, a Mexican restaurant nearby. It's over-priced and the food quality is not great.

ReviewText:I was very impressed by the Loews location. It is in the middle of all the action on Hollywood and Highland, within walking distance to famous landmarks and bars. The front desk agent found out it was my birthday and upgraded us to a suite. The room was fabulous. There were some minor issues, but the front desk staff and security were very receptive. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I will definitely stay at this hotel again.

ReviewText:The pool bar closed at 3, we arrived to the pool at 3. There were no robes provided in the room. -newline- The best part of the stay was the cocktail waitress in the hotel lobby bar. I don't remembe her name but she was attentive, friendly and was representative of the hotel staff. We were visiting our son who lives in nearby Silver Lake. There are lots of good dining options and shopping nearby.
