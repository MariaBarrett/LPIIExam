ReviewText:I needed an affordable place close to the airport to stay for a night. I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is really nice and it has a shuttle that makes transportation from the hotel to the airport easy. The staff is incredible friendly. I will definitely stay there again.

ReviewText:We have stayed at the Hacienda several times because it's location. We find it a good place to stay except theTV sets are old and they don't have cable.

ReviewText:The hotel is pretty disgusting and gross. We went into our rooms and then checked out to a near double tree hotel.

ReviewText:This hotel is very close to LAX but I never heard the planes. The hotel was built in stages, the older side has nice courtyards with fountains, the newer side is next to the pool, with better rooms. I stayed in the older side and the bed was comfortable. The pool is nice, and if you like to walk the town of El Segundo has coffee shops, restaurants and shops. Continue down the hill to the beach.

ReviewText:The staff was unusual....young lady at the check in counter had a leather jacket on, and acted like it was a chore to answer any questions...... -newline- I left a wake up call for 5:45 and they called me at 4 AM in the morning.....they should have compensated me for that mistake....other than that, it was decent. I would pay a little more the next time for a better hotel though

ReviewText:This hotel is not worth it's rating. The room was located in another building, far from the front desk, the water in the shower/tub would not come on, and after 2 phone calls and a trip back to the desk we were finally able to use it. In addition we were charged $50 until they look at the room to make sure we didn't dirty it. Although we ran the air conditioning all night it was still not cool. And don't even think about eating in their restaurant.

ReviewText:The reviews on this hotel were great, however it did not live up to the reviews. The room was a block away and I had to get a hotel engineer to turn the water on in the shower. That took 2 phone calls and a trip to the desk. The air conditioning was on all night and the room still did not cool down. The food at the restaurant was just frozen meals heated up. And besides that I was overcharged.
