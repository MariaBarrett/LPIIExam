ReviewText:From the beginning, the staff from the Valet to the Front Desk were very nice and personable. -newline-  -newline- We went to the Magic Castle for the night and it is perfect walking distance to all things we needed. A CVS to Louie Vuitton. The Roosevelt is hard to beat when wanting to stay in a high end convenient space in Hollywood. -newline-  -newline- Usually we stay at the Renaissance, which is very nice. But there is something about the Roosevelt that just stands out and puts the Renaissance to shame. -newline-  -newline- We will be staying here more often. It was GREAT!

ReviewText:Quick check in, friendly staff. -newline- Great burgers at 22 Degrees. -newline- Don't forget that the lobby bar will get crowded on weekend nights & will host the occasional party...may be able to hear noise on lower floors.

ReviewText:Great location and lots to see and do in the area.  I was helping my college age son move into his apt and found this hotel to be an oasis.  Spotted some stars and went to a few TV shows in the area. -newline-  -newline- Pool an interesting mix at night and liked the energy. -newline-  -newline- Two of there restaurants not open and no one told me about the in house bar bowling alley until I checked out! -newline-  -newline- I would recommend this hotel and the Gild (Their sister hotel near Wall St in NYC)

ReviewText:This is old Hollywood - home to the original Academy Awards, but still hip as ever. I loved my room - great city view, spacious, and very comfortable. Great hotel staff other than one cocktail server by the pool - she was a nightmare. But her replacement was a total pro and on top of things. You really can't beat this location.

ReviewText:Stayed for three days over a weekend.  Excellent location near the Kodak theater and the Hollywood & Highland metro.  I rode the train to downtown and North Hollywood with ease.  The Hotel was sleek and the room nicely remodeled, but a not quite worth the cost.  Great atmosphere and really busy at night; not for those seeking peace and quiet!  The pool bar and restaurant are hangouts for Hollywood locals (and supposedly celebrities, I only saw one) so be prepared to mingle if you head down.

ReviewText:We went for a party and hotel had an excellent location.  Front desk people were a bit ditsy, doormen and other staff were wonderful, restaraunt was excellent.  Rooms were small as expected in old (historic) hotel but fine.... we had view of Gruman Chinese Theater and Hollywood sign from our rooms.

ReviewText:Location in Hollywood was ideal.  The staff was very helpful and friendly.  I was surprised at the room size for an older hotel.  Not big, but it accommodated four people - we did not spend a great deal of time in the room.
