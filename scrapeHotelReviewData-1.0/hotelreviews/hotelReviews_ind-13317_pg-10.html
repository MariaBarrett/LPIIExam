ReviewText:Only Valet Parking available which cost a lot. You can park on the street at your own risk. The rooms are clean and things are brand new. Rooms are small. I would rate this hotel as 3.5 stars.

ReviewText:The hotel had a great location in burbank; albeit it was a little difficult to find because it blended in with the surrounding houses and condos.  It was really close to everything i wanted to do and see, and was right next to the WB studios.  The staff was great..very friendly and knowledgeable about the surrounding area.

ReviewText:We had a wonderful and very comfortable stay. My one complaint was the breakfast was very expensive at the hotel and was of just mediocre quality.

ReviewText:Small, interesting hotel. Tasteful, well appointed room (Deluxe) with kitchenette (refrigerator, sink, coffee machine, microwave.) Staff was quite helpful with all requests. Intimate pool and jacuzzi on the roof. HDTV, clock radio (docked w/iPod). Walk to restaurants. Bank, grocery and drug store across the street. Near Warner Bros and Disney/ABC. Fairly late check out (12:00P). Only drawback, no self parking unless on street, leaving pricey valet as only option on hotel grounds.

ReviewText:A great location for access to either the valley, downtown LA (and convention center) or west LA/Santa Monica.  But the best part is a super friendly, helpful staff in a great facility that is small, comfortable pulled off with great style.

ReviewText:We had a great time staying at the Hotel Amarano.  It was in a great location, not far from Warner Brothers studios.  The rooms were very nice and luxurious. There is valet parking for $28 a day, but  we parked on the street and it was just fine.  The only problem we encountered was the hot tub had cooled down as the area closes at 10pm.(A little too early, I think) -newline- Highly recommend the Amarano.

ReviewText:It was our 1st year anniversary!  To celebrate our weekend, we drove straight to Universal Studios and had a whole day of fun, fun, fun!  Then at dinner time, we headed for our hotel stay.  I'll have to say we were quite nervous about our hotel stay because we had had so many recent hotel stays that were just unpleasant and even raunchy!  I guess you get what you pay for!  You see, we don't get the privilege to stay at luxury hotels because it's always about the money.  However, this time for the first time, we were determined to stay somewhere nice for once, so we saved our money for one nice hotel stay.  We work too darn hard in this world to stay in a raunchy hotel again!  We would have to agree that our stay was the best we have ever stayed in our adult lives if you could believe.  And we are 34!  It was better than the Tropicana in Las Vegas that my fiance's employer paid for and better than the grand hotel my employer had us stay in San Diego: both of which we did not have to pay for!  My favorite part of Hotel Amarano Burbank were the minty colors of choice.  It gave the room a new vigor and cleanliness that I really hold of high importance.  Everything was spotless.  I especially loved the shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and lotion, magnified mirror and 7ft to 8ft by 4 ft mirror for a woman's grooming convenience!  It was the first time I did not use my own, since I am extremely picky with this kind of thing.  My fiance's favorite item in the hotel was the 46 inch flat screen LG TV with a Panasonic DVD (electronic details complimentary to my fiance).  This deluxe hotel with a King is perfect for the couple in love!  The mini kitchen made it very nice for me to make my hunny breakfast in the morning, since we had brought so much food for the trip.  I'm glad we did.  Continental breakfast just doesn't do the job for us.  We had a very romantic and tasty dinner at Smokehouse just down the street and had left over steak and boiled eggs as well as freshly cut veggies and fruit, blueberry muffins, and freshly brewed coffee.  The freshly brewed coffee was provided by the hotel.  If you really have some cash to spend, there was basically a fridge full of a variety of liquor for the alcohol drinker as well as some assorted candies, but we didn't get any of that.  But what a convenience!  The bed was extremely comfortable.  I really enjoyed the two sliding doors I could open in the morning or late at night to allow some fresh air in the room.  I found it nice to be able to sit at the desk to plan out our day in downtown LA and Venice Beach.  I especially love the check out time of NOON!  I'm so used to 11:00am and rushing to get out.  The only thing that caught me by surprise was the parking.  I had no idea that I wasn't going to be able to park my own car.  It is all Valet parking.  I kept thinking, "Oh gosh, another expense that I did not expect!"  Sure enough, a little over $31 a day for Valet parking!  I really wish this would change!  Customers should really be able to have other parking options.  And the Valet men stand there for a tip: sad thing is, I don't carry cash, so I hope they didn't think I was rude when I didn't tip.  Although I loved this hotel stay and I would stay here again, I do plan on checking other hotels and their accommodations as far as parking and their pricing before I book or just save extra money to accommodate this parking cost.  Despite the parking expense, we really enjoyed our stay and wished we could have stayed at least one more day, since we didn't even get the chance to enjoy the spa!
