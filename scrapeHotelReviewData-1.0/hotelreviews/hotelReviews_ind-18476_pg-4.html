ReviewText:I didn't really like my experience. I'm pregnant and my sense of smell is really sensitive. The room smelled like stale urine and the heater didn't work. Also, housekeeping didn't do a very good job and weren't friendly. When I called about the smell in the room, someone at the front desk said there was nothing they could do. We spoke to the manager at check out who apologized and told us to contact the website we purchased the hotel through, but I don't really see what that will do. All of the clothes I brought home now have that same stale urine smell, and I'm a little sad that I paid $250 for this experience. I won't be staying at that hotel again.

ReviewText:If you need to get back and forth to LAX, this is the place to stay! Not only is it close, but there's a free shuttle to get you there. Beyond that, there are numerous restaurants, a great grocery store, and a Starbucks right across the street. I found a nice nail salon less than a block away. -newline- However, if you need reliable internet service while you're at the hotel, you may find the connection at Hacienda problematic. I finally had to create a personal hotspot with my phone to use my laptop. Also, it was unseasonably cool while I was in LA, and I could not get the room heat to come on. I tried everything, but nothing ever warmed up that room. This may not seem like a problem to most people, but I'm from Florida, and the forty degree temps at night were pretty uncomfortable. -newline- So, this hotel is a nice, clean, comfortable hotel with no frills for the basic business traveler, but if you can't create your own hotspot for wifi, you may be upset.

ReviewText:Could have been better for the price I paid. I wasn't looking for a high-end hotel but this one disappointed me from get go. Average customer service, average rooms, terrible noise from the street and sounds everywhere, bad cell phone reception and horrible wireless reception in the room. The only thing going for it was the location which is right next to LAX and has several food placing within walking distance.

ReviewText:It's better than sleeping on the streets, right? Maybe not. I think we would have a better experience if we slept in our car. -newline-  -newline- Beware of the cheap deals. The west wing is like the haunted hall from The Shinning or the forbidden wing from Beauty and the Beast. -newline-  -newline- We got a room with two twin beds and didn't know. The room had a warning sign saying that there's chemicals in the room that may cause cancer. There was a white large pill on the floor. The sheets smelled like bleach. To top it off, the toilet did not flush, so we had to scoop water from the sink to fill the toilet bowl. -newline-  -newline- Horrible Horrible Experience. -newline-  -newline- The great thing was that we were able to check out the next day, one day early... and Orbtiz refund for the night we didn't stay.

ReviewText:We arrived in the evening and the shuttle picked us up and we were checked in within minutes of arriving! Upon checkout in the morning we were shuttled back to the airport and on to our next shuttle for the car rental place. Very friendly staff! Starbucks across the road!

ReviewText:the hotel is about 10 mins walk to the nearest metro station, and there are fast food restaurants near the hotel. lt.'s close to airport but far from every other things. One thing that l'm not satisfied with is that during our stay, the hotel's phone rang several times around 5am in the morning. That's annoying and scary, l told the manager but didn't get the problem solved. so l have to unplug the wire. But besides that other things are nice.
