ReviewText:Great hotel. Staff was very helpful. Jacuzzi and sun deck on the 4th floor were very nice. Our room, 218, was directly over the lounge terrace--unfortunately we had to call down twice to ask people to stop smoking (posted signs state no smkg). Request a room that is not directly over the lounge. Room was clean, beautifully decorated and very comfortable bed. Ice bucket was dirty. Made good use of kitchenette fully stocked with dishes for two. Valet parking is $28/day. We parked around the corner on the street. Residential area and we felt very safe parking our car among other condo/apt owners. Side entrance to the hotel made this very convenient. Dining prices at the hotel were $$$$ so we chose to eat across the street at several places. Recommend the pumpkin pancakes at BeaBea's, pricey for breakfast but great food and friendly staff.  Also ToGo sandwiches, take-out Japanese rest/sushi, Italian place.  Von's groc convenient also. Great place/location.

ReviewText:I really enjoyed my stay at the Amarano. So much so that I stayed an additional night. The staff was pleasant and accomodating. I was in Burbank to visit my family but I require privacy so the Amarano became my home away from home. -newline-  -newline- The only comment is that no one answers the phone when you call room service after 11:00 and there is a limited 24 hour menu. If you don't call the front desk you will have to wait for breakfast.

ReviewText:The hotel had a great location.  It was very close to WB Studios in Burbank and the Burbank airport. The hotel claims to have a car that will bring you where you want to go, however it is first come first serve and the car does not operate until about 6:30 or 7 am so if you have an early flight plan on paying for a taxi (about $20 to the Burbank airport). [...]We ended up getting a two double bed deluxe room (smaller) when we paid for a superior room (larger). There is a drug store and grocery store across from the hotel which is a nice bonus in case of midnight munchies or lost baggage. Friendly staff. Beautiful lobby. Room had a couple issues...broken toilet seat, lamps by bed did not work, heat never kicked in. Otherwise quiet and comfortable.

ReviewText:The first room we checked into was a little small, but the staff was very friendly and accomodating.  They had a nice local shuttle which helped get us around as needed.

ReviewText:This was my second stay at the hotel within a month and again, I commend this hotel. It is warm and comfy as though you're coming back home especially after a whirlwind day of sightseeing, shopping, or just being on the road for hours.  Love the decor of the rooms. -newline-  -newline- Unfortunately the front staff does't quite generate the same feel of the rooms although the valet and restaurant help are great!
