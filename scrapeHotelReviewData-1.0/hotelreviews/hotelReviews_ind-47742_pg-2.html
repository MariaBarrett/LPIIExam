ReviewText:It was a lovely stay, bed was worth every penny and the staff always went an extra mile to help in any way they could. Noe restaurant has the best scallop dish, amazing food, the atmosphere needs improvement. The prices for mini fridge items, etc. has become standard and it is sad that this hotel follows that trend. Way too expensive. They also charge for wifi. Amazing location, we would stay again

ReviewText:The Omni is a very nice hotel. Older, but very well kept. Not as new as other I have stayed at, but again very well maintained. The room was perfectly up to date. Price was excellent compared to similar hotels like the Marriot, which is where I last stayed. The Marriot was a bit nicer in that it is newer, but value wise, I'm happy I chose the Omni this time. Because of location the Omni would be an excellent choice if you are planning a visit to the Music Center.

ReviewText:Great location for downtown activities and central enough to get to other parts of town easily. Rooms are spacious and quiet. Staff is incredibly friendly. Would happily stay at the Omni again.

ReviewText:Stayed two nights while attending a conference in LA. It wasn't convenient to the Nokia Theater, but I had a good time exploring the nearby Disney Concert Hall and the Museum of Contemporary Art. -newline-  -newline- The hotel was quiet, in good shape and the interior finishes looked fairly current. The interior architectural design, however, is dated. -newline-  -newline- The bellman staff was fantastic and the front desk was very helpful..

ReviewText:I stayed for 3 nights with my two-and-a-half year old son. The staff was universally friendly and helpful, catering to our requests with apparent pleasure. The room was perfectly clean and very comfortable. At my request, the staff provided a crib; it was quite small but adequate. -newline-  -newline- Room service was fast and the food was delicious. We didn't visit any of the on-site restaurants or cafes. -newline-  -newline- My only concern with the room is that there was a very low window with no screen that my son could open (I parked the crib in front of it thereby forestalling the problem). -newline-  -newline- The pool is an outdoor pool, supposedly heated - but we found it to be too cold for a swim after sundown. There is no hot tub. The exercise room is well-appointed and wasn't busy while we were there. I would have liked to indulge in spa services, but couldn't do so with a toddler in tow. -newline-  -newline- The location is great for taking public transportation to attractions all over the city (e.g. the Zoo and the La Brea Tar Pits). It is, however, pretty weird if you're on foot: on one side of the hotel the street is on the first/ground level; on the other side it's on the third floor level. If you manage to find yourself below street level (easily done) you can wander about for quite a distance before figuring out where you ought to be. (Of course this isn't the fault of the hotel, just something to be prepared for if you visit.) -newline-  -newline- Also be aware that the financial district does keep standard business hours, so many local cafes might be closed on weekends and/or evenings.

ReviewText:The hotel located in downtown LA which is far away from those landmarks and nice restaurants. It is more a business environment for those who goes there for business. If you want travel there, suggest not live in this hotel. They offer tour to those landmarks which is called Starline. It is good but the price is fairly high.
