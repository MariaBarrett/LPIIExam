ReviewText:We stayed from Friday to Sunday they charge $ 8.00 in parking a day, at night when returning there is no parking. Called the supervisor she asked me what I wanted her to do about it. Very poor customer Services. Air Conditioning in hotel room didn't work. I will never stay here again.

ReviewText:Well located for airport with convenient airport shuttle. Hotel is a bit dated and no frills, but decent value for an overnight.

ReviewText:We have stayed at the Hacienda Hotel several times before and it seems to be a hit or miss. This last visit seems to be the worst though. First, the guy at the front desk couldn't spell my name right. He printed the registration form twice and I just corrected my name by hand on the second form. Then he gave us an already occupied room. So, we went back to the front desk and the lady gave us Room 1336 which was exactly where the dumpster and construction was (we were in direct view of the construction crew). The main light was motion-sensored which turned off every few minutes and the wall lamp was broken. The sheets were crinkly like paper, but at least they were clean. Also, the construction crew started (jackhammering) at 6am which undertsandably angered another guest. The male guest swore and yelled at them, which made them postpone the work to 9am.

ReviewText:I have been in Boston for five years, and for the first time was able to fly back home to LA for a one week vacation with my son. Before he was born, my husband and I lived and worked a few blocks from the Hacienda Hotel but had never been there. Also, the freeway entrance to the 105 is a few blocks away, and that is a launching pad to anywhere in LA. -newline-  -newline- Here's the scoop: -newline- - Location: perfect. Near the airport but not so close that airplane noise is a problem, so it's a very short time from baggage check to relaxing in your room. There is a Ralph's grocery store, Walgreen's pharmacy, and Starbucks across the street. Also across the street/within the block: about 7 different restaurant choices (Five Guys, El Pollo Loco, Carl's Jr, and much more. It's right next to two gas stations when you have to fill up your rental car. -newline-  -newline- - Room: honestly, it looks like the building has been there for 25+ years. It's a little run down (cracks in tile, a crazy old air conditioner/heater panel, etc). But it's CLEAN. We were in the South Tower, which is a bit of a walk from the lobby. Ask for a south facing room so you have a nicer view (view from the other side is laundry room and other hotel rooms). -newline-  -newline- - Beds: Clean, fluffy duvet and starchy linens. Pillows were fluffy. We slept just fine. -newline-  -newline- - Amenities in the room: just about none - no refrigerator (but no bugs either!), no-name shampoo, soap, and moisturizer. -newline-  -newline- - Windows: South Tower doors are about 6' high and open fully. There is a +/- 4' iron fixture that would not be easy to climb. Still, when we were in our first room facing north on the 5th floor, it worried me to have the door open with my 5 year old who loves to climb. -newline-  -newline- - Hotel amenities: has restaurant and bar on site, and that bar is BUSY. There is good night life at this hotel. There is a lovely area to the south of the South Tower that has a lush grassy area with the pool next to it. It's a paradise to hide away in for a while - a must visit. -newline-  -newline- - Airport Shuttle: leaves every 15 to 20 minutes to the airport, and same for pickup. The drivers often proactively inquired when they saw us if we needed a ride. -newline-  -newline- - Staff: Everyone was super friendly and helpful. The concierge saved our trip when we went looking for my son's loist turtle - the concierge had him on the mantel and gave him back to my son with a huge smile. -newline-  -newline- - Overall: if you want to stay in a 'nice' hotel, this is not the place for you. This is, however, absolutely the BEST hotel you will get at this price. You just can't beat this rate, everything else in this neighborhood is awful. If you're going to be going to Disney etc like us and not spend a lot of time there, then who needs luxury? We just wanted nice beds and friendly staff, and we got it. Also, the hotel's spanish themed grounds are nice. And there's little things like the cold water at the front door with orange or strawberry slices and containers of lollipops that we dropped by each day. -newline-  -newline- Highly recommended for cost-conscious travellers who want the ideal location - you can get most anything by walking one block!

ReviewText:We've stayed at plenty hotels but this one was not clear nor did it look clean. It was too rustic and the halls were dingy looking. It was just alright for a one night stay but I wouldn't recommend it.

ReviewText:The staff was very accommodating. We arrived an hour before check in time, which wasn't a problem at all. We were able to choose the location of our room and were given a frig on our request. The room was clean, bed was comfortable and pillows were great! -newline-  -newline- I would definitely stay there again.

ReviewText:Room was clean....Sheets and comforter were white, -newline- (which is a nice Touch in the age of bedbug paranoia) -newline- Whater pressure was nice and and the shuttle to LAX -newline- ran on time....never tried the food, but the staff was friendly...no complaints here. 3 stars is accurate. Grocery store nearby, but not refrigerator.

ReviewText:i cant comment on a lot since i wasn't in the room long enough to even sit down. -newline-  -newline- i should have gotten a hint when i couldn't find my room. i didn't know the elevator had a mind of its own and is a gamble if it actually goes to your floor and if it does go to your floor...the door may not open. -newline-  -newline- when i turned on the a/c, it blew warm air. after i went to get some ice... i finally found a working ice machine on the 6th floor (i am on 2nd floor), i returned to a hot room. i come to learn that there is no a/c in the hotel! -newline-  -newline- after about 45 min and $30/night more...i am in a nice cool hotel room, with free parking to boot! -newline-  -newline- AVOID THIS PLACE!
