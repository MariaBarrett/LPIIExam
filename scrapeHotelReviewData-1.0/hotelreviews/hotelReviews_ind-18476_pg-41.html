ReviewText:The price with [website] was just good, i would not pay the hotel price for the place. I'd rather go to a known chain.

ReviewText:Under staffed at the desk so we had a long wait to check in. Bed was old and lumpy. Everything had an old appearance. This hotel is on the downhill side of life.

ReviewText:We went to LA on vacation. We chose the Hacienda because of the great location and awesome price. The room was hard to find and parking was a little far. We had to park behind a gas station because they ran out of room. The room was clean and served our needs. The bathroom floor was not. We found a few hairs on the floor and on the toliet seat. I would possibly stay here again if I was looking for something simple with no frills.

ReviewText:I like the location.  I like the hotel overall.  I wish there were more diet friendly meals at the restuarant.  Room was musty, but after I aired it out it was okay.  Bed was comfortable.

ReviewText:Everyone who worked there seemed to hate their job or they were all rude and did not care to help me with anything. The beds and bathrooms were gross and I felt dirty after I showered.

ReviewText:Had an early flight out of LAX so I stayed here for one night.   Arrived late and check-in was quick and easy.  I had a room in the South tower and it was a bit of a walk to get there.  Otherwise stay was very good.  Breakfast was included in my room and it was simple to redeem the voucher.  Restaurant staff was very friendly.  Airport shuttle was right on time.
