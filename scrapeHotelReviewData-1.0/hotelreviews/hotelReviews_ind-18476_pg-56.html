ReviewText:I was satisfied with our accomodations.  The desk staff was fairly indifferent, but the area was fine.  I would stay there again, but not for an extended period.

ReviewText:The Hacienda Hotel in El Segundo, California, is a somewhat older hotel that does not have individual room air conditioning.  Instead, it is centrally controlled throughout the hotel, as as a result, it became very warm in my room at night, when the hotel air was either off or turned down very low.      Upon check-in, the room had not been cleaned, and the front desk and housekeeping had not communicated that it needed to be cleaned. Although I had requested an early check-in time of 2:00 p.m., I had to call housekeeping myself to request that my room be cleaned, and it was 2:15 p.m. (normal check-in is 3:00 p.m.)      also, the housekeeping staff lost my husband's swim trunks, which were on the bed when we left for the day and not there when we returned.  The next day, the Manager-On-duty, gave us a hard time about reimbursing the amount we paid to purchase new trunks so we could go into the pool again.

ReviewText:This is an old hotel that has been partially remodeled, but only as far as the front desk, lobby, club and restaurant areas.      The room reeked of stale odors, smoke, and the heating/ac left much to be desired.  I had to open the window in order to adjust the temperature as well as tolerate the odors.      The bath only had a shower stall, and was positioned so close to the wall I had to squeeze to get in and out of the shower.      I'd recommend the bar's dance floor,and the food was average in the restaurant - nothing else was worth nearly the money I spent for it.      After I arrived at the hotel (and spent $20 on a cab to arrive), I was told about their courtesy van to/from LAX.

ReviewText:My wife and I visited our two college kids With the high cost of college The rates here were appreciated.  I feel we got our moneys worth.     The only gripe I have has to do with two things.  The front desk attendant should have been more understanding.  And the hotel overnite parking on Saturday night was awful.  Other than that i would tell my friends to stay there.

ReviewText:I was staying at the Hacienda, and had a conference at the LAX Hilton.  Taxis were $15 for less than one mile and the shuttle would not take us there.  I would not stay there on business again.

ReviewText:I found the Hacienda Hotel to be very convenient. My business was made much easier by the fact that it is minutes from LAX, close to major freeways & has a convenient shuttle to & from LAX every 15 or 20 minutes, 24-hours a day. I appreciated my quiet & spacious room on the 5th floor of the South Tower. I enjoyed the hotel's comfortable patio & it's very courteous and friendly staff. It was very helpful that there are several fast food restaurants, a supermarket, Starbucks, a bank and a 24-hour pharmacy within walking distance of the Hacienda.

ReviewText:The Hacienda Hotel was very nice, clean and comfortable.  The rooms are just the perfect size for either a short or a long stay.  The beds are comfortable, the rooms are clean, and the bathrooms are big and functional.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The location is perfect.  It is surrounded by several restaurants, supermarket, pharmacy, gas stations, and even banks.  Easy and fast access to freeway and airport.  Everything was nice except the fact that there is no free parking, which sometimes it is hard to find an open space.
