ReviewText:It was amazing! Super clean and comfortable. The staff was always ready to assist. The only problem was that the keys to the rooms stopped working once but thats about the only problem.

ReviewText:This hotel seemed to look very nice from the pictures, offer a prime location and the Hilton name. The hotel wasn't bad, I mean it was clean, comfy bed, but nothing extraordinary for almost $200 a night. I get it, its downtown, but I would have rather paid more for something exciting and extraordinary. Or perhaps pay less for something outside of dowtown.

ReviewText:This is a first class hotel with all the charm of a small hotel. Everything was very nice, with the exception of the pool which was unacessable because top floor is being turned into a presidential suite. Also, dishes in the hall the whole time we were there. But other than that I'd stay again. The beds were very nicely appointed and there are lots of great restaurants within walking distance.
