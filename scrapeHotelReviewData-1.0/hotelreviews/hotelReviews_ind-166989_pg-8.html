ReviewText:Nice hotel,friendly staff. Got upgraded due to noise from adjoining room (happy with that)great pool area. Bus stop at the front door so it made it easy to get around. Hotel arranged a car to take us back to the airport at a very reasonable price. Would stay here again.

ReviewText:Even though it is quite a maze getting from the lobby to your room with your baggage. Everything else was great once we were settled in. We would stay here again!

ReviewText:I was visiting LA for business. Here are my complaints: -newline- •  Didn't like the fact that I had to pay $15 a day to use the internet service--this should be part of the room package, as it is with many hotels. -newline- • The TV reception wasn't great either, although I didn't watch much anyway. Crummy selection of OnDemand movies. -newline- • The whirlpool was never very hot -newline-  -newline- The hotel was quiet and well-maintained, my room was great, loved the mini-kitchen.  My bathroom was very small, but the shower was hot and had great pressure.  The pool was always the perfect temperature, and a good size for doing laps.  The staff was very pleasant.  Did not get a chance to use the restaurant.

ReviewText:One of the best of the 7 hotels in USA we stayed in over last 6.5 weeks. Good position for Beverley Hills as good Wilshire Blvd bus (bus stop at door) to Rodeo drive and Santa Monica beach only $1.25. Nice small restaurant at hotel but pity no other eating places nearby. We were leaving on 11.30pm flight to Australia and hotel kindly allowed us to use pool after check out at 12 noon but no pool rest room showers. However we recommend this hotel

ReviewText:The hotel has a very impressive, newly remodeled entrance when you first pull up. The staff was very friendly and helpful and my room was clean. The hotel is located on Wilshire Blvd in Beverly Hills but its at least six or seven long blocks from any coffee shop, store or any real shopping areas. The area is really residential and quiet. Please consider driving or renting a car for convenience when staying here. The hotel has two sides, one has elevators and overlooks the pool, cabanas and the courtyard while the other side provides only a small maze of staircases to gain access to your room and I found this side to be somewhat secluded. Definitely find out what side of the hotel your room is on before booking. I was overall satisfied with my experience but would probably stay in Century City next time and be close to shopping and other conveniences.

ReviewText:This hotel was great.  The staff was extremely friendly and the rooms were a great size.  It is definitely an older hotel though and getting to your room can be tricky (I went up one floor then had about 5 sets of "mini" stairs) so if you have a lot of luggage you should get some help!

ReviewText:The hotel was very well managed, and beatifully appointed, in a great location and overall great. The hotel is upscale, and the staff extremely friendly. The only thing we didn't like was the fact that they shut the hot tub off at 9 p.m. (it was okay, we still enjoyed it for 30 mintues before it got freezing cold), and we had too many stairs to climb to our room with our heavy luggage. I wish they would have offered to bring the bags to our room, but no one did. Parking is not included and you have to pay $20 per night for it, which is fine  but it's still a bit pricey. The gym is small but nice, and the pool area is beautiful.  The on-site restaurant has great breakfast but exceptionally pricey ($17 omelette!). Despite it all we enjoyed it very much and the room was absolutely HUGE and wonderfully appointed.
