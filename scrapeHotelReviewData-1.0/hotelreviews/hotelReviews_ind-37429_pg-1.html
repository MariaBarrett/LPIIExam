ReviewText:We checked in on 05/22/2014 for 3 nights. Third night was free. Great place to stay and close to all attractions especially Universal Studios which was the purpose of our trip. Only complaint is the ice machine did not work and we had to call room service each time we needed a bucket of ice. A Hilton Hotel should have working ice machines. Would we stay at this hotel again? Yes!!

ReviewText:I only stayed at this hotel so I could be with a colleague. I had a number of problems with things in my room, plus, in the middle of the night, there was loud talking that woke me up. I've stayed here before and had the same problem. Porter's, the restaurant in the hotel was closed for renovation (no work was going on), so we were forced to eat in the bar. They claimed is was the same food, but was only mediocre. My colleague and I agreed, this is the last time we'll stay at this hotel.

ReviewText:I had a wonderful stay; I really can't find a thing to be unhappy about. Beautiful hotel, centrally located, with clean, well appointed rooms and friendly, courteous staff. These features are the reason I chose this hotel this time and why I'll choose it again when staying in the area.

ReviewText:King bed with lots of pillows was good for sleeping. Bartender on Saturday night was very good and extremely polite. TV froze one evening but was OK in the morning.
