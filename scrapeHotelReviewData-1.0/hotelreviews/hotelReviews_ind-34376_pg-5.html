ReviewText:Hotel has a great location and it is first rate. However, Orbitz's rate did not disclose $12 per night parking fee and $13 buffet breakfast - no complementary breakfasts. The total cost didn't turn out to be such a great bargain after all. We would stay there again because the location is so convenient to shopping, meals, and the 210 freeway.

ReviewText:I am a business travelor.  On the one hand, I have no major complaints about the hotel facilities nor the service I received.  It was clean, things were done within a reasonable time, the location is near plenty of food and entertainment vendors, etc.
