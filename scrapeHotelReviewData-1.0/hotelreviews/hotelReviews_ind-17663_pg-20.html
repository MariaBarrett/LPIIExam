ReviewText:No elevators, no room service, dirty pool, noisy workers start maintenance works from 7am, very noisy. Limited parking spaces. Far from most attractions with the heavy traffic of LA.

ReviewText:We visited family in the Sherman Oaks area so this worked out perfect. The room was clean and very comfortable. Everything was perfect except if you are a light sleeper. Next to the road and noisy. May be better in the back of the hotel.

ReviewText:Overall experience was good. We were in town for a wedding and the location was central and fit our needs. The hotel itself had more of a motel feel to it as the rooms opened up to Sepulveda Blvd and the Denny's shared a parking lot. Opening the door of the hotel let in the waft of odors coming from the Dennys as well as the hustle and bustle of Sepulveda which is a very busy street. The rooms and the property were well kept and relatively clean. The bathrooms did not have working fan/vents and room service never left enough replacement towels. -newline- Other than that, everything was ok and if I had to, I would book again. No real amenities to speak of except for a 10% discount at the Denny's.

ReviewText:We were very disappointed in these accomodations. We had no hot water in the shower or sinks for 2 days. After contacting the front desk, we were told they had completely sold out for the night. They also stated no other rooms were having this problem, but they would see what they could do. We wonder if they had overbooked, and gave us a room that was scheduled for repair, and this room should not have been occupied for the weekend (even though we made our reservations over a month in advance!) The staff promised to contact management. However, at this writing, no attempts have been made to contact us or compensate for our visit . Needless to say, we will never book with this hotel, or for that matter, Best Western, again.

ReviewText:I visited Los Angeles to help a friend. This hotel was a short distance from their home and was perfect. Very easy to get to and it was clean and quiet. Plenty of parking and have no complaints.

ReviewText:The hotel was excellent it was located in the perfect location. It was close to everything we needed. The main road it was located on was easy to get around to any part of the city. Overall it was a great stay at the Holiday Inn. The room was clean, the staff were helpful and pleasant. -newline- I would recommend staying here to anyone who was looking for a place to stay in LA.

ReviewText:Clearly an older establishment in what is still an industrial section of Sepulveda Blvd in Sherman Oaks. That said, the housekeeping staff and staff in general do a good job maintaining the place from what I saw. The staff is also very friendly based on my four days there. The rooms and facility in general need updating though; really soft mattresses, old style television not a flat screen, etc. but again the housekeeping staff does a good job. I was in the "Tower Suites" which has a separate semi-enclosed parking area. I would have been concerned about parking my car in the open parking lot otherwise. The biggest complaint I have is that the walls are very thin and its really easy to hear conversations in the next room. In my case, the person next door spent much of Saturday morning in a profanity laced phone conversation which I heard in more detail than I wanted. In summary, if I were traveling alone or with another adult, I wouldn't have any issues staying there for one night (ask for the Tower Suites though). I would not recommend this as a place to stay with your family for a few days though. again, the staff appears to be doing a good job with what they have but its still an old hotel in an industrial neighborhood literally right next to the Interstate (think "road noise" here). -newline-  -newline- Also be advised that this hotel will place a $50 hold on your credit card in case of "incidentals". There's no mini-bar or anything so I can't say where these incidentals would come from. -newline-  -newline- I have said I would not recommend this hotel because I don't think the above caveats constitute a recommendation. I would share my experience with a friend and tell them to make their own decision though. -newline-  -newline- No real value per se; about what you should expect from an very inexpensive motel.
