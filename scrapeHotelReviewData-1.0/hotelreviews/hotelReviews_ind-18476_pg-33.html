ReviewText:Staff were very friendly. Food is available until 1am. Met a woman that complained about service but I feel she was the type that complain often instead of sorting for the positives. Shuttle service was punctual, room was clean. -newline-  -newline- Needs improvement: the bathroom needs to be detailed. Tile grout on the floor could use a good scrubbing and the shower nooks and crannies (under soap tray, under tub spout both had buildup). Hall carpet on 8th floor had an odor from water leakage. I heard a guest claim that it smelled of cat urine, but I'm sure that was not the case. It was clear where water leaked from most of the window frames I passed into the hall carpet. -newline-  -newline- I think it is tidy and friendly for a budget hotel. It was recommended to me by a flight attendant and I feel it was more than adequate for what I required. The food by the way was really inexpensive and had great flavor. -newline-  -newline- 5 STAR Location: minutes from LAX, Starbucks, Subway, many restaurants and a large retail grocery within a few steps of the hotel. You couldn't ask for more on a layover! -newline-  -newline- My advice, if you want more, pay more. If you are a simple person with good manners and you frequent hotels, you can understand minor infrastruture issues and appreciate friendly pricing. It's about wants vs. needs ;)

ReviewText:This hotel is definitely convenient to LAX. The room was clean and comfortable. If it weren't for noisy kids playing in the hallway until 11PM or so our one night would have been better. It was also pouring rain and there were a number of buckets in the lobby area. One of the sofas in the lobby was also getting dripped on.

ReviewText:The staff are were very courteous, EXCEPT the shuttle bus driver. However, my issue w/ this hotel is.. the rooms need to be cleaned. Carpets were dirty (seriously needs a shampoo), the room smelled like cigarettes, I stated on my reservation the room was for 2, my room only had towels for one person, I had to call the front desk twice for extra towels,no extra shampoo or conditionder, soap, etc. just terrible. It was like staying at a Motel 8 instead of a place that had a high star rankings [...]... Lastly... I mentioned the Shuttle Buss driver.. I had to be at the airoprt by 5:30 am. Driver showed up and as he took my luggage to load.. I'm very polite.. always say please, thank you, etc. Well, immediately when this guy took my luggage he gave me the most horrible attitude, never said "you're welcome" when I thanked him, when I got to the airport I once again said thank you.. and the jerk gave me the silent treatment, yet when the gentleman behind me thanked him.. he spoke to him!!?! I don't know what the prejudice was towards me but, it was complete disrespect.. Needless to say.. I WILL NOT EVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN... I don't care how bad I need a room..

ReviewText:I stayed one night after sightseeing in Los Angeles. The access to LAX was very nice and that to downtown was not bad. The room with good perfume was comfortable. Amenity was simple. No buffet in breakfast although the price was reasonable.

ReviewText:I chose this for the location, close to LAX with free shuttle service to the airport.  I was traveling with my very elderly parents, so this was important. The staff was very friendly, room service food was better than most and the shuttle was effecient. The rooms are a little old with a slight old smell, but the beds were comfortable and bedding was nice.  The pillows are hard as bricks. I will stay here again.
