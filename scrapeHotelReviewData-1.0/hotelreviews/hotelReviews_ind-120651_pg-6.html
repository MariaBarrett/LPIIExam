ReviewText:Was with my girlfriend and was impressed with the nice staff.  She and I had a nice quiet night of sleep which you always don't get when you stay at a hotel.

ReviewText:Great hotel stay.  From fast and efficient check-in through check-out, everything was tops.  The recommendations for dinner from the concierge were right on target.  Rooms were perfectly clean.  The food served for the business meeting I attended was excellent.  All opportunities for service were very personable and attentive.  Would have preferred that the Hyatt took the time to label the TV stations in the room TV (CBS, FOX, etc.).   As an out-of-towner, without the station labels pre-programmed, it was challenging to figure out the stations.  Not a big deal, but the only customer moment that this Hyatt missed. [...]

ReviewText:We were in town for a wedding so we were not able to actually partake in too many of the hotels ammenities. However, the bar is very nice and the pool looked awesome.  Also, the hotel is right next to the Century City Plaza if you wanted to do some shopping or see a movie or grab some food.

ReviewText:I found the hotel well decorated but a stark and cold ambiance - I would not stay there again - I think they are short of staff and seem not to take much inerest in their clientel.

ReviewText:I took my 16 year old daughter and a friend of hers to Los Angeles for a shopping trip.  We chose Century City as we liked the shopping and location.  The hotel was across the street from the Westfield Mall, 5 minutes away from The Grove and 10 minutes away from the Santa Monica pier- GREAT LOCATION!! -newline- The staff was great, rooms were nice other than the flat sheet verses a fitted sheet on the matress which drove me crazy due to the wrinkles. -newline- All in all, we had a great stay even though there was construction Saturday morning at a hotel next to ours.

ReviewText:We've stayed here before, and while the location is very good, the hotel itself was more just okay for the price.  This time the stay went very well (we're usually here for a week), and we have nothing to complain about:  housekeeping was much better, the front desk was friendlier, etc.  Now if they'd just do something about those internet fees... -newline- You can get free wireless in the lobby, but as that's also a major bar area, thats not always the greatest place to work.
