ReviewText:I've stayed at this location many times over the past five years.  Good location in Burbank, close enough to LA, Hollywood, beaches.  Reasonable and competitive pricing.

ReviewText:Cotton sheets were yummy, thank you. I've stayed at more expensive hotels and all they had were cotton blends. It was like sleeping in my own bed. -newline-  -newline- Fan in the bathroom was rather loud, would have preferred a separate switch.

ReviewText:This was a quick visit (just one night) for us.  The free airport shuttle was a huge bonus for us.  Courteous drivers that were on time.  Unable to check in early (2 hours) but the concierge desk took care of our bags for us in the mean time.  Clean room.  Quiet location.  We would stay here again.

ReviewText:Hotel was perfect for our vacation needs.  It was central to all of the attractions that Burbank has to offer.  It was easy to find, even for someone who has never been to the area.  Short trip, less than 30 minutes, from LAX.  Hotel wasn't exactly the most up to date in terms of decor, but it was quiet and clean and the staff was awesome.  Pool is outdoors and the weather was a bit cooler so we didn't try that out.  There were also tons of fantastic restuarants either right across the street or just a few blocks down.
