ReviewText:You can't beat the location.  Easy access to Sunset, Hollywood and Santa Monica Blvd.  Also, a supermarket is a quick drive and a drug store is in walking distance not to mention the mall across the street.  Our first room was very small and not what we expected for $300 a night but the real problem was that the bathroom door didn't close all the way so you had little privacy.  Also, our view was the mall parking lot.  We complained a little and were able to get another room (many thanks to Elmer and the staff) the same day.  The next day, we were offered another room - bigger and with a view of the Hollywood Hills.  Since we were staying for 4 days that was really nice.  We still don't get why the bathroom doors (they are sliding doors) don't close tightly - maybe it's more for singles than families.  The rest of our stay was great.  The only other complaint would be that the only refrigerator is the stocked one so there is no room for anything else.  No coffee maker in the room but they do offer free coffee in the lobby.  If you rent a car which you almost have to in LA, and you go in and out a lot, you'll spend lots in tipping the valet guys and like most hotels now there is that annoying $29 per night parking charge. I suppose you could park somewhere on the streets behind the hotel but there are fences and other obstacles so I don't think it's worth it. Because of the close proximity to a major hospital, you will hear sirens periodically during the day and night but it really didn't bother us.  Room service is expensive - $30 for a personal size pizza and a bowl of soup which was not very good.  The lounge was lively and a celeb or two might have been seen but in LA you can't tell if it's really them or someone trying to look like one :-) -newline- Overall, I would definitely stay there again because of the location and the staff. If you have kids and don't plan on renting a car then this is not the place though.  But, if you want to jump in the car, head up to the Griddle Cafe on Sunset or head to Santa Monica, Hollywood or the Farmers Market than you are at the right place.  It's about 12 miles from LAX.

ReviewText:Absolutely fantastic. The only draw back was the hotle room was a little on the small side. What the heck, i'm not in LA to stay in the room. I would definitely return. Thumbs Up. Loved the mall across the street.

ReviewText:The hotel looks great and the staff were entusiastic and helpful. I am in LA every month and have stayed at another hotel that costs more and has a great reputation. For a fast 2-3 day trip I would and will(through you) now stay at the Sofital. The only thing that was lacking was a bathtub in the room.But the bathroom itself was designed very well.

ReviewText:I went to the Sofitel with two girlfriends, for an all girls vacation.  From the minute, the staff was helpful, and really rolled out the red carpet for us.  They made reservations, called cars, and offered helpful advice on things to do in the area.  The locaiton was perfect, walking distance to shopping on Robertson and close to great restaurants and bars.  I would reccommend this hotel to anyone, particularly if you want to have the LA Glam experience.

ReviewText:The room was small but very comfortable. The pool was a joke - too small. Overall, the hotel was very nice and comfortable. Our one complaint was the conceirge service. On two seperate occasions no one bothered to inform us that they were unable to secure our reservations for dinner.

ReviewText:The Sofitel in Beverly Hills was wonderful. We had a late flight into LA and thought we were in trouble when we arrived...a guest decided to stay another night, so our room was not available. They paid for a cab and we were sent to another hotel for one night. When we checked in we were upgraded to a top floor suite overlooking the hills. WOW! The staff was very helpful and more than made up for the one night situation. The bed was so comfortable. Each room including the bathroom had a flat screen TV. The remote control shade in the bedroom was awesome. The bar area was incredible. I would recommend to anyone wanting to visit LA.

ReviewText:Our room was absolutely beautiful and the shower was awesome.  The feather bed was comfortable, but it had no top sheet, so when the nice, thick duvet got a bit warm, we had no option other than nothing or the duvet.      The other criticism was that we were on the street side of the hotel on the 6th floor and there was apparently a party going on at the restaurant below us with a DJ, etc.  It was extremely noisy until about 1:45 am.  Our friends were on the other side of the hotel and said it was very quiet.  Hopefully, Sofitel will look into soundproofing the rooms on the street side.
