ReviewText:We took a road trip for our honeymoon and decided to go to Los Angeles. Our hotel room was amazing! The staff was very friendly we mentioned we were on our honeymoon and they gave us drink vouchers for the hotel restaurant. We decided later to stay another night and we arrived to our room and  had champagne and chocolate covered strawberries and a card from the hotel congratulating us on our marriage! We would definitely stay here again!

ReviewText:Omni Downtown LA is just great. Quick valet parking. Great restaurants in house, with amazing breakfast buffet. I could go on, but essentially the conclusion is that the hotel experience at Omni was great. Highly recommended!

ReviewText:I chose this hotel for the price and proximity to my office.  It was about 7 blocks away and a manageable walk.  The hotel was great.  The room was comfortable and visually appealing.  The dining options varied more than what I would normally choose but was still excellent.

ReviewText:The room was very nice.  My complaint is, when I booked the room [...] I specifically asked for a smoking room with a king bed and for breakfast we didnt get what we asked for.  The Omni Hotel was a completely non smoking hotel.  So because we are smokers, we were not comfortable, we had to go outside in the cold.  I think if we are going to pay $200/night + Food & Valet, we should be able to get what we ask for.  My wife and I were very disappointed.  The hotel personnel was very nice and courteous. [...]
