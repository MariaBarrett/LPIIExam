ReviewText:We had read all of the previous reviews and were more than a little nervous about our upcoming hotel stay.  The was the best loction as I was just a block away from the training location I was going to.  Needless to say we were VERY happy with our room (we stayed in the South tower - with the portal-type window/doors that were able to open all the way).  The ONLY complaint was that the bed was a little too hard.  The TV in our room was very dark and red.  The staff was very quick to replace  the tv as they were unable to fix it.  We had a Great stay and would definitly stay there again.

ReviewText:The room was small, not well aired and didnt have a clean and well kept appearance. Not worth the cost. I had stayed here 2 years ago and that was a much nicer experience. -newline- The staff were very nice and helpful though.

ReviewText:Parking was the worst. Had to pay $5 a night and it was a parking lot across the street. First lot I went to was full and had to drive down to a different lot. From check in until I got to my room it took me over 30 mins.

ReviewText:We stayed for 6 nights. Rooms ok but carpet in the rooms is dirty. On site restaurant is great with good prices. Supermarket and Starbucks across the street, Ihop and Carls Jr. a few blocks away. Overall location not too bad and close to the airport without a lot of noise. Staff was friendly and helpful. Good value for the money and nice pool area.

ReviewText:I never post a review for any hotels that I stay in. But this one is an exception..I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT! We arrived late from the airport and when we checked in our room, it had the old hotel smell, musty. We asked for another room, which they gave us and its odor was not as bad.  I figured one night,okay. Not so, we finally got into bed at about midnight and could hear snoring from who knows where. Then at about 2am other noises. Then the room somewhere, upstairs or next door had a 4am wake up call which rang 4xs before they answered,and I could hear their whole conversation until they left. Then at 7am the hotel decided to do some heavy cleaning nearby. It was a horrible experience. When checking out, I had to pay a parking fee. Once again, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL

ReviewText:Great value for the price. The hotel is a bit aged but well kept and very up to date with its amenities as well as facilities. The hotel itself is very beautiful in decor featuring a great open courtyard and its own restaurant. The central location itself is great with both LAX and Manhattan Beach within minutes of the stay as well as major attractions within decent driving distance. The only negative is the TERRIBLE parking conditions, not only are you asked to pay $5.00 a night (which is a choice), but you're also subject to not even getting a spot because BOTH lots are generally full most of the day and packed to capacity at night. -newline-  -newline- As stated, great value for your dime, just watch the parking bit and you'll be fine.
