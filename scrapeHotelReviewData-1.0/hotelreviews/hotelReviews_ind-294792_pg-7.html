ReviewText:My boyfriend and I stayed at The Standard for one night while we had tickets to a Laker game.  Overall, the experience was pleasant with the exception of the alarm clock going off in our room at 6:00am.  I found this very annoying since we didnt have to wake up early at all!  Otherwise, it was a nice hotel, just wished there was more of a crowd, afterall, it was New Year's weekend.

ReviewText:First room we entered was undone - kinda bad leadoff to the holiday. Requested room change, second one was the same size, I would've thought they would try to upgrade at least for the inconvenience. Had to request bathing robes twice - why can't they just replace the old ones every day? -newline-  -newline- Rooftop was said to be the new go-to place in downtown, but after reading through a few Yelp reviews, decided not to because it was over-priced. -newline-  -newline- Distance to Universal Studios or K-town was fairly close, so that was good - it took 30 minutes to get to Santa Monica, so that wasn't that bad.

ReviewText:Arriving at the hotel I got an greeting from valet which helped me with my luggage, front desk was very fast with check in [...] was veryyyyy helpful along her was a very nice gentleman I forgot his name but he was very nice, at first I was a little scared about how the service was going to be because o have read some reviews with less satisfied customers but I had a great time ..weekends is where I gotten kindve annoyed with the party vibe, my husband was playing pool in the lobby around 130am ,that's when the roof top closed every one from the party came to the lobby to make out and hang out.. that was a big let down, the standard should let the Party people exit the hotel because it deturbs ur actual hotel guest... everything was perfect besides that after party in the hotel lobby ..

ReviewText:Having stayed in hotels in 36 countries, I would say that I am a world traveler. With that said, you can take it from me that this is not where you want to stay. An example would be coming back to the room after a lunch appointment and finding that the 1 glass that was left for me had a huge crack in it. I didnt complain, but instead used the glass because I was in a hurry to make a few calls before I had my next appointment. The next day when I arrived back in the room, the bed was made, but the glass was still sitting where I had left it, and there were no towels. -newline- That was what it was- I didnt complain. However, when a friend who lives in LA came to the hotel to visit, the worst experience of my travels was about to happen. My friend brought homemade ice cream, but didnt bring any spoons. So, rather than calling House Keeping for a couple of spoons, I went down to the Front Desk.  I waited there for close to 45 minutes while one person after another was helped. Everyone who came to that desk AFTER me was helped, but the Front Desk person would not help me, but kept looking at me to make sure I caught on that he was aware that I was there, but he wasnt going to help me. -newline- I spoke with the Manager the next day about this, and was informed "No, he wouldnt do that. He is a great guy."  Well he did do that. He deliberately insulted me, and for no reason at all- I was dressed well, had my room key in hand, and was all smiles talking to my friend while we waited.  Thus I must delcare that he wasnt helping me because I am white, or because I am gay, or because my friend there with me is Hispanic. Either way, there is no excuse for it.  We all have our bad days, but that doesnt make it ok to be just down right rude to people. -newline- Therefore, I am going to tell it like it is- no more nice guy for them- As far as ammenities, there is a tacky gym in the middle of the building- thus, no windows, but it has the nicest wood paneling from the 60's if you care to workout in a wood box. -newline- At check in, the staff is very proud to inform you that you get 2 passes to the the roof top deck every night- Which I found that is when it becomes a hip hop club that brings in people that you will eventually see on the evening news.  The club is hoppin all night, but dont worry if you cant make it up to the deck, you can hear the music and the people all the way down to your room- ALL NIGHT. -newline- I could continue with the horrors of my stay here, but will leave it at this: -newline- Dont lower yourself to their "Standard"

ReviewText:This was the first trip my fiance and I took together and we had the best time! The staff were very helpful, the place was amazing and it had the best perks. I'd suggest this place to any hip person who wants to have an amazing time in Downtown LA and the other surrounding cities!

ReviewText:Location is close to everything downtown and very convenient to the 7th Street Metro Station subway.  For the price, I would have expected at least a coffee pot in the room and a pillow that didn't deflate.  Also, I booked a king-bed room since that was all that was availalbe, but what I didn't know was that two entire walls of the bathroom were glass!  I was traveling with my mother so we had to take turns leaving the room so that the other could shower.  The boiler broke on the first day so we were both left to take a cold shower.  When we called the Front Desk, they did comp 2 of our room service meals, but only did so upon request. -newline- The hotel is hip and cool.. the design is interesting and very European, but in trying to be different, it just lacked too many "standards" of hotel travel in the U.S.  I would not go back unless significant improvements were made or the price dropped way down.

ReviewText:Initially a little intimidating but only because we were jet lagged! But after gaining sleep were more and more impressed by facilities and the location. Polite and helpful staff and the place oozes coolness without even trying. If you bring an open mind you can enjoy an almost sublime experience. -newline- We were on the 10th floor and noise from above was simply not an issue! Awesome experience and would definitely stay again. Heated pool rocks!!!

ReviewText:I've stayed here multiple times and it's hit and miss at the front desk, as far as sweetness is concerned. No  complaints, tho.
