ReviewText:We were visiting Colburn School which was in the same plaza as the hotel in downtown.  The hotel is tastefully and beautifully and beautifully decorated. The room was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was the best part of the room with a separate shower. The hotel had the internet access but only with extra charge. The guests had to pay for every minimal use of equipment in the business center including internet service.  The only place you can get bottle of water or soda was at the small shop at a highly inflated price. Even a bottle of water in the bathroom had a tag of $6. -newline-  -newline- Omni was very comfortable to stay at but it was hard to take the extra costs of everything I became used to be included in the basic service in other hotels.

ReviewText:Our little LA Christmas getaway got off to a shaky start. I'd booked a room at another hotel, the Kawada (oy vey) on another travel site. The Kawada was a complete disaster. I quickly whipped out the smartphone, pulled up [...]and booked another hotel a block away. Found The Omni. Vacation saved! The staff at the Omni is top notch. Now that I think about it, they were all on the young side. They were completely attentive, eager to please, a class act all the way. From the valet and room staff to the bell desk to the front desk, everyone greeted us with a smile and went the extra mile to make us happy. I can't say enough about the Omni employees.The room itself was spacious and clean. The carpeting and bathroom looked a bit lived-in and the TV was a slightly outdated 27" tube, but that's nitpicking.The $10/day wi-fi fees are waived when you sign up for the Omni rewards program, and serves up a speedy connection. Valet parking is a bit pricey, $30/day, which is probably typical for business traveler hotels - nobody complains about the parking rate when it's on the company dime. There are a couple of cheap public lots in the vicinity if you don't mind walking a block or so. When I got home, I noticed a mysterious $4-$5 charge on my bill. Not worth the time to complain, so I didn't bother, although I'm sure the Omni would have reversed the charge without incident.Overall, I'd give staff and service a 10, the room an 8, rates and fees a 7. I'd go back, and I'd recommend The Omni to anyone looking for a good room and great service. It's not the ultimate romantic luxury hotel, but perfect for a couple on a weekend getaway, or a demanding business traveler.

ReviewText:This was my second stay at this hotel in the past two months. It truly is superior. Upon arrival, really great doormen earnestly greet you to assist. The spacious lobby is always sparkling clean and filled with flowers. Rooms are well appointed, super clean, and have a separate shower and bathtub. Great water pressure in shower, and hot water is truly hot. All staff are superior in every respect. Late night room service is reasonably priced, and dishes were excellent. Hotel restaurant menu needs to be expanded or updated although the shrimp and watermelon appetizers were very good. Hotel is walking distance to federal and state courthouses, and City Hall.

ReviewText:We went to a couple of baseball games, sight seeing and general relaxation. The hotel and bar are top notch. The staff, especially at the front door and town car service we're as good as I have ever seene. The fitness room was as good as anywhere I have been in the past. I wished the pool was bigger, deeper and more accessable to sun in the late afternoon. Understandable with the location of the hotel though. I would have liked to see a washer and dryer for self use during the stay.

ReviewText:This hotel was very clean and in a great downtown location.  We only had a couple of small bags which were easy to carry and so it was great not being forced to have them brought up to our room for us especially since we didn't have anything less than a $100 bill after just arriving in the US.  I would certainly stay there again.

ReviewText:I loved the Omni hotel in LA.  99% great stay!  Only things that annoyed me was unfriendly staff person when I called at 2am due to internet not working.  Rest time I loved it.  Even had a free refrigerator sent to the room. -newline-  -newline- The amenities are great!  Lots of a little perks for staying here.
