ReviewText:Great beds and bedding!  Love that bedding is all washable so there are no worries about about dingy comforters.  Carpeting was a bit wrinkled from cleaning, but nothing that impacted the quality of the room. Great staff to help with any questions.  You do have to pay $14 a day for parking but that is with in and out priviledges.  Excellent food on site.

ReviewText:Great room, comfortable bed, clean. I could hear some traffic off the 405, and I could hear people in the next room, but to be fair it was about 1 in the morning and it sounded like they'd been at the bar for a while

ReviewText:Hotel is centrally located and made our travels convenient.  The staff was ALWAYS very accommodating, making certain that we were satisfied with everything.  My only disappointment was the daily parking fee of $14 that was added in addition to staying there.  Additional cost of $98 was NOT appreciated.

ReviewText:Upon entering our room (#534) I was pleasantly surprised. It was spacious, clean and with nice decor. The bathroom on the other hand was weird. For some reason we were put in a handicapped accessible room which had us dodging all manner of old rusting safety rails in the shower as well as a shower head that I had to rig to get it up to a height that a normal person would use. I could have lived with all this but later that night when we got back to our room we returned to find our room was flooded out from a leak in the unit above us. This meant we had to pack up all our stuff and move to another room (1033) just at a time that we were ready to enjoy some rest and relaxation after a long day. The staff was courteous enough about the whole episode and offered us a complimentary breakfast as well as parking, which was appreciated. The room we moved to had it's peculiarities too though. One of the bedside light was coming off the wall, another lamp in the room didn't work and the carpet was all gathered and bunched up giving the appearance of a somewhat dangerous situation. And to top it all off on the last night of my stay we lost power in one half of the unit (the side with the TV, fridge and desk light). It was the end of the day - I could live without all those items for another 12 hours in lieu of hosting a repair person in my room while I was packing up for my departure. All in all it was a lovely hotel fraught with many little complications and annoyances. Staff was pleasant.

ReviewText:I have stayed before and had a good trip.  However, this time there was construction above my head until 5pm.  There is no room service for lunch - it does not began until 5pm.  The bathroom was falling apart.  The internet did not work in my room, although it worked in the lobby. I had work due that night so it upset me that I couldn't get anything to eat and I couldn't do my work in my room.

ReviewText:Initially went to the wrong hotel (Radisson LAX). Front desk called the shuttle driver and he picked us up and took us to the Culver City location. Clean hotel, friendly staff, great bar and restaurant in the hotel. Restaurants and movie theatre within walking distance. Great location because it's close to the airport but in a quiet location within walking distance to restaurants and movie theatre. Couldn't ask for more.

ReviewText:Easy access to West LA sites.  Excellent bathrooms and comes with a bathrobe (thankfully).  Room was spacious but the dial-a-stiffness bed didn't suit me too well.  Great value for the money.

ReviewText:The staff is very curtious and helpfull. The service was top notch. The only draw back was the noise from the highway all night long.
