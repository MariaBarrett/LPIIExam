ReviewText:I attended an event at the Convention Center with a few family members and friends. I loved the staff hospitality as we did not know the city. Your inclusive snacks were great- definitely above average and appreciated at the end of a long day. My only disappointment was in the quality of the queen mattress we had. Too lumpy. Also the bathroom fans are weak and can't handle quick showers before become like a sauna! However, the beauty, history and location however is second to none!

ReviewText:it was like going back a century but with all the modern amenities the room was really spacious, beds and bed linens of superb quality, quiet in spite of being in the middle of down-town L.A. -newline- I must say though the restaurants are not so inviting being always desserted and with very short working -newline- hours, but check the bottega loui on grand and 7th a real treat! form breakfast to late dinner!!

ReviewText:I recommend this hotel ONLY to travelers with a car. i didn't know that its location, downtown in LA is the most dangerous part of LA until i went out for a walk for a while in early evening. How could have i imagined that the area which has many beautiful buildings and expensive places is dangerous? Walking around this hotel is kind of risky adventure, so if you wanna stay here without a car, you'd better stay in the building, and move to other places by a taxi. but if you don't mind this dangerous street, just go out and enjoy the things around this hotel, becuz there are many fancy restaurants, bars, and cafes all over around. i strongly recommend to visit LA library and nearby cafe, it's beautiful. -newline-  -newline- Except for location, even if it didn't feel like 4-stars without the lobby and the exterior of hotel, everything was just fine and price-reasonable; i went there with REASONABLE price. Lobby was the most impressing part of this hotel becuz it was rly grand and looked like a historical constructure. The staffs were all very kind and helpful. However, it was little bit shocked that there was no fridge and abt 10 dollars internet was so slow.

ReviewText:The hotel rooms are dirty, the staff was rude when asking for the room to be serviced and prepared appropriately. I feel like I was cheated and will never stay ever again.

ReviewText:A staff stole my necklace from the 7th floor on the morning of June 16, 2013 between 9 - 11 am. Security has refused to share the list of people who have entered my room. I'm currently working with LAPD to see what can be done. I know there's little chance of getting the necklace back (it's a wedding gift with a lot of meaning) but I think it's important to get this on the record.

ReviewText:We stayed at this hotel for what we thought was a relatively low price. However they get you with 40$ parking, and 10$ wifi. This I thought was just insane, I think they can let up at least 10$ or 20$ for parking and having to pay for wifi is kind of a joke. I understand they need to make money but I think they can let up on those prices. Other than that it was a pretty nice hotel, the room was nice and comfortable and the service was excellent.

ReviewText:Just as there are many LAs, there are many ways to create or experience the LA of your choice, via your hotel stay. Passing on a motel that's generic, or a chi-chi modernist approach, the Biltmore was the way to go, to sample the elegance of a by gone era, where people dressed for dinner, and made a entrance, via a grand staircase! -newline-  -newline- But don't let the appearances fool you- the Biltmore is secured here in the 21st century, and has the gentle perks and amenities one expects from today's hotels, just quieter, more personal and with sincerity. -newline-  -newline- Location: you simply can't be the location for many reasons. It's very centrally located, especially since LA is a driving town. Pasadena. Santa Monica, Westwood- are really a short drive away. You are right next to the freeway system. But more importantly, you're at the heart of old LA with so many treasures in walking distance, under 10 minutes: Historic sites like Grand Central Market, Angel's Flight funicular, the LA Library and City Hall and the famed Bradbury Building (Blade Runner) are near by. The Toy, Jewelry and Fashion (Garment districts ) are 10 minutes away, a shoppers paradise of selection, culture and color. The Walt Disney Music Hall, MOCA and Olvera Street plus Union Station are also minutes way. If you have the need- Little Tokyo and Chinatown are about 15 minutes away. -newline-  -newline- You can park relatively inexpensively across the street from $6- 20 dollars if you have a rental car. -newline-  -newline- You want to Visit the POOL, Sauna and Stream room, check out the JAZZ downstairs and certainly bring your CAMERA to take pics inside the hotel- simply beautiful Beaux Arts stylings! -newline- And, i'll add the room is HUGE and was surprisingly Quiet- always appreciated! -newline-  -newline- the Only thing i wasn't thrilled by? No mini fridge and internet cost $9.95 per 24 hrs. Boo :(

ReviewText:The hotel is older, but very well kept. It was the suggested hotel from this site, and it was very nice, and seemed priced appropriately. Continental breakfast was great, parking is kind of an issue though. They valet it for $40/night which is excessive, but there is a garage across the street. Also, the location is great if you're there for business, but not so convenient for sight seeing.
