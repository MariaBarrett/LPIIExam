ReviewText:We stayed at the Pasadena Hilton for a long weekend getaway. What a great location - walking distance to coffee shops, cafes and restaurants (both chain and local), shopping and night life in old town Pasadena. The hotel staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and accomodating. We were originally placed into a handicap room (which neither of us are) and the staff were understanding and accomodating to move us into another room wihtout any issue, and even moved our bags for us while we were out for the day. We stopped into the restaurant for a beer and spoke with who we assumed to be the restaurant manager, and had a really nice chat with him about Los Angeles and the surrounding area. There are comfortable chairs in the lobby area to relax in if you need to kill some time. Room was clean, bed was comfortable, sheets were soft and bathroom toiletries were wonderful. I'd definitely stay here again!!!

ReviewText:my parents visited pasadena for a week, and i booked marriot for first 5 days and hilton for the last 2 days ( i simply booked the cheaper one for each period). and apparently my parents liked hilton better, mostly because of better room conditions.

ReviewText:So it was the Hilton and along with that, comes the prestige of the name. It was very clean and a great location for where I needed to be. Maybe this is the norm but there were certain things I would expect to be included in the cost of the room like wifi($9.95 / day) and parking ($18 / day). -newline-  -newline- If I had known this was the case, I would have stayed somewhere else. Everything else was great and the staff was very helpful to find me a place to get some late dinner at 1:00 AM. They even looked up the number and called the IHOP for me. -newline-  -newline- Room was great and very comfortable.

ReviewText:Very expensive - I have never paid $200 for a three star hotel and that did not include internet ($10) and parking ($18). The worst thing though was that I purchased a room with a king bed but they gave me a room with two double beds. When I brought this to their attention they said they were under no obligation to honor this request from your company. I was celebrating my anniversary with my wife and they showed no desire to help me out
