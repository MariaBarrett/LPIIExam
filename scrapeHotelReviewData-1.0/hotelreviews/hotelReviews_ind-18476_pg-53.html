ReviewText:I need to control my own a/c. This was not good for me. I slept with the window open and there was no screen. And I did not like the parking the fact that I had to pay for parking each night was a little upsetting when the parking was around the corner. From this experience I will be sure to look for these 2 important details for other overnight stays.

ReviewText:The hotel was pleasant enough but would have liked a small bar fridge in the room. The staff at the front desk were not friendly, bordering on rude.

ReviewText:Stayed overnight on way to and return from Hawaii.  Hotel was clean and convenient for someone who has never been in LA Noisy due to closeness to LAX. Should provide a little more info on how to get shuttle from airport (where to get on, color etc.)

ReviewText:this was my second stay at the Hacienda Hotel. I plan to stay here every time I fly into LAX. It's a quick drive from the airport and the welcome I receive here is sincere and friendly - just what I need after a late arrival following a 6 hour flight. the hotel is definitely old and doesn't have that antiseptic sameness that the big chains have. If you stay here, be sure to enjoy an excellent breakfast at the restaurant. All in all, it's a one of a kind, very friendly hotel.

ReviewText:I arrived at LAX and called the hotel and was advised that the shuttle would pick me up in 10 minutes. I re-called the hotel in 30 minutes and again was told the shuttle was on its way. After 1 hour I called again and was told the same story. Finally i hitched a ride with the Doubletree shuttle who took me to the hotel for free 90 minutes after my first call to the hotel.

ReviewText:The hotel was like a little oasis in the city. The gardens and court yard are breathtaking, the maid staff was excellent and did a very good job cleaning the rooms, the little diner connected to the hotel had a real retro-kitsch style with excellent food and service. There is a great shuttle service that takes you to and from LAX which is a perk for sure. There is dancing in the bar at night, and everyone we met as far as the staff goes, were very, very helpful. This would have been the perfect place, if the windows opened up more in the rooms and the upper hallways because the place needed to be aired out. The California air makes things stuffy I think.  We stayed in the west tower, and it seemed that the windows on that side weren't as nice as our friends who stayed in the south tower. We did have a cool mini fridge and they didn't, which in a strange way made up for the not so functional windows. Also the elevators were pretty aged. Not aged like good cheese or wine, but aged like a rusty piece of metal that might break at any time! Kinda scary, so we took the stairs most the time. This place is great for young couples that want to stay at a cool place that is very affordable. We will defiantly be back!
