ReviewText:Stayed for a night with my husband. AC wasn't really working, so as Wifi, very slow. Overall room felt damp.But the location of the hotel is really great, airport shuttle frequency is good, didn't have to wait too long. Got free breakfast coupons as we booked from [...], which came in really handy next morning, as we were tired after a long journey. I would recommend it for short stay or if you need a place to crash in the night, get ready and get going in the morning.

ReviewText:Very good accommodation which included a last minute 4-day extension.  However, the face of racial discrimination occurred Sunday, April 10th when I was guided past empty tables to be seated against the wall by hostess [...].

ReviewText:Generally good. But, the hotel is not as good as advertised. -newline- Somethings, like WiFi connection and pool cleanliness, were problematic. -newline- But, on the whole it was not too bad.

ReviewText:A bit more than you average airport  inn. That said it is a bit on the older side of rustic and the road noise from Highway 1 is noticeable. I would not plan a long stay at this hotel unless you absolutely need to save cash. The rates were very competitive [...]. The hotel is a short drive to downtown el sugundo and the beach towns past that.

ReviewText:The location was good for my destination. The hotel wall was real thin and the conversation from other rooms were carried over especially later at night. Plenty of places to eat around the area. Convenient commute to interested landmarks.
