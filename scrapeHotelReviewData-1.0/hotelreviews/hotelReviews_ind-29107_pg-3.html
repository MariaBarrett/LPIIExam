ReviewText:The room was not as premium as I had hoped for a Loews property, but I thought it was decent for my purposes. I'd stay there again but with a better understanding of my expectations.

ReviewText:Fantastic experience! The location is in the heart of Hollywood and has easy access to everywhere.We especially enjoyed the ease of eating, shopping and enjoying the street scene! Great room with awesome view - Felt like we were in Vegas ( or Cairo) as we gazed on the giant Egyptian structure around the pool.The lobby bar produced a whopper Martini but it would have been nice to have a lite appetizer menu available.Parking was expensive!!

ReviewText:I booked the room at 8am. Arrived at 3pm and was offered a junior suite for an additional fee. I declined and received the suite at no extra cost. The front desk staff was extremely kind.

ReviewText:Perhaps if we hadn't just come from staying at a 4 star hotel in Huntington Beach where the staff were really friendly and the rooms top class, we may have been more impressed with Renaissance/Loews Hotel Hollywood. As it was, it made a bad impression from the start. The staff behind the desk were indifferent and ignored us, despite the best efforts of our 8 mth old daughter to flirt with them. We were shown to our room which turned out not to have the hollywood sign view we had paid for, or indeed any view at all, unless you count air-conditioning units on nearby roofs. Our bell-boy, Santos, was lovely and organised our room with a view for us plus suggested a fridge for our daughter's bottles. -newline-  -newline- The room was large and clean but the beds were small, hardly Queen size and the bathroom was out dated and small. -newline-  -newline- The next evening, returning late to our room after a long day, we found ourselves locked out. Upon enquiring at the desk, we were told that we had been checked out, they had no record of our 2nd night booking and wouldn't take our word for it, asking us for "proof". We had to bring down a print out of the original booking and there was no apology even when my husband expressed his displeasure. He was so annoyed by this stage that he asked to see the manager, who was effusively apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast. However, the whole episode left a sour taste in our mouths. -newline-  -newline- Upon arriving home, we realised that we had left our baby monitor in the room. We have rung the hotel twice so far leaving messages with the lost and found department. We are still waiting for a response, 2 days later. No, I would not recommend staying at this hotel.

ReviewText:Wonderful room with a great view of the Hollywood sign. Beds are super comfortable and the staff are very pleasant. Very close to Hollywood Blvd and all the excitement. We swam in the heated pool and exercised in the gym. We had a fanstastic stay here and would come again. -newline-  -newline- Hargrove Family -newline- San Diego, CA
