ReviewText:Great place to stay. One of the nicest Holiday Inns I have ever stayed at. Everything you need for your stay is with walking distance.

ReviewText:What a great hotel experience. We arrived very late and didn't get the room I wanted so they very graciously accommadated with the room I wanted the next morning. Well informed and friendly staff. -newline- We really looked forward to the Breakfast Buffet every morning...even the TOAST was delicious! -newline- Very conveniently located to the Burbank Airport, but far enough away to be in beautiful Burbank. Lots of places to walk to, great restaurants and mall all within walking distance. -newline- Free aiport shuttle that leaves every half hour. I would defintitely go back again!

ReviewText:Large, clean rooms that include a mini-fridge, coffee maker and iron.  The hotel restaurant could be better in terms of items offered, but the staff was great.  Other than those aspects, this location also offers a fitness center, pool, and business office center - none of which I had the need or time to use this time around.

ReviewText:I went to Burbank to visit friends. Found the Hotel clean, friendly staff, centrally located. -newline- The rooms were only slightly updated, but clean. The beds were comfortable, the view from my room was great. -newline- My only complaint was the wireless service was so-so. When I called the front desk, they offered little help. Otherwise, a great experience. I will definitely consider this Hotel again in the future.

ReviewText:It was perfect location to visit local studio tours and also within walking of many, many restaurants and even a mall.  Good neighborhood,  didn't feel at all apprehensive about walking around at night.  And we were two women by ourselves.  Everyone is very freindly and it was a great get away
