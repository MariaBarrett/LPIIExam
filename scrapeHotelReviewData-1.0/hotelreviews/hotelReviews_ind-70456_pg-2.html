ReviewText:I had a great experience at The Roosevelt. It was very close to the venue I had to be at each day as well as close to restaurants and attractions. The beds and pillows are amazing! Overall, nice experience.

ReviewText:Simply Phenomenal. Beautiful hotel, very nice staff, they even upgraded my room for free. Very fancy rooms, clean, comfortable, perfect for young couples or small groups that are looking to have fun. They have pool parties with live DJ playing almost eveyr night. I got to see some celebrities hangin out there too. Amazing experience and the price was unbelivable, compared to the amazing luxurious accomodations of this hotel. I'd definitely go back!

ReviewText:The hotel/room was clean, historic, and in a great location across from the wax museum and Grauman's chinese theater. The elevators were slow (up to 30 minute wait at times), but otherwise my stay was great. The staff was professional and helpful.

ReviewText:Good hotel for fun pool party atmosphere. Great location, however staff were not as freindly or welcoming. E.x. front-desk staff acted as if they are doing you a favor for checking you in or when I asked for a glass of water with my lunch order at the pool the waitress pointed to the bar area for me to go get my own water.

ReviewText:The location is unbeatable. You really are across the street from the walk of fame. The hotel is by far the nicest one in the area. Many of the other hotels in this neighborhood looked run down or unsafe. -newline- I was upgraded when I arrive from a cabana garden view to a cabana balcony view. There is something going on at the pool every night. It can be a bit loud, but I enjoyed listening to watching all of the fun from my room. The music seems to just stop at 1:30 at last call and then it's silent. If you are in LA for business, a cabana pool room is not recommended. -newline- I would stay here again in a heartbeat!

ReviewText:My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in January to escape the cold of NYC and it was fantastic! The staff was more than accomodating but not overbearing, and the valet service was wonderful.

ReviewText:This hotel on Hollywood Blvd. is where you want to be for the sites of Hollywood. Walk out the door and The Kodak Theatre and Graumen's are a two minute walk. The Hollywood Walk of Fame is of course right under your feet. Best staff I've ever encountered. The place is clean, high class and beautiful. Usually when you go to the pool in a resort, you see a bunch of people who shouldn't be in bathing suits, but not here. I thought I was at The Playboy Mansion!. The pool is a party scene on the weekends as the have DJ until 2am. There are also cubs and dining in the building. When I go to Hollywood from now on, this is where I'm staying.

ReviewText:Beautiful common spaces. Stunning garden and pool area. Our room reeked of cigarette smoke and had a lot of dings on the furniture. Looks like they are a busy hotel that gets a ton of traffic. The bed linen was clean and the beds were comfy. The toilet was clogged by the prior guest. After it over flowed, the maintenance people were prompt about fixing it. The street was filled with a wide array of freaks and hustlers to watch. The valets did a great job. Food at Public Restaurant was incredible until both me and my roommate found hair in our salad. They didn't charge us for the food or drinks but felt disappointed and disgusted for the remainder of our visit. Small greasy spoon diner in the front of the building had awesome onion rings.
