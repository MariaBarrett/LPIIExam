ReviewText:Great hotel.  We loved our stay here.  Location is excellent, close (but not too close) to LAX. Very convenient supermarket next door and walking distance to the 	The Promenade at Howard Hughes Center, with movie Theater and restaurants.  Great price, even better with Orbitz.  Stayed here before, defenatevly coming back. Thanks Orbitz!

ReviewText:We were in Los Angeles because my daughter is moving into an apartment in the city. The hotel and its excellent respite from the the myriad details of the move. The staff was friendly and courteous, the accommodations were first rate and the location of the hotel was perfect for the things we needed to do in the city.

ReviewText:The room was immaculate and the bed was a Sleep Number Bed. It was SO comfortable. The room was well appointed and quiet even though we were close to major traffic.

ReviewText:This hotel is not in a great location if you want to be near anything of interest in LA.  It is close to the freeway, but that is a little annoying if you are trying to relax by the pool.  We booked this because of the great rate, but were disappointed that they charge an additional $14 a day to park there.  The staff was generally unenthusiastic and the internet access consisted of 2 kiosks in the lobby with super slow connections (although I think they also offered wireless access if you have your own laptop).  One night we decided to relax in our room and called to request a corkscrew from the front desk.  They told us we needed to bring our bottle of wine down to the bar and the bartender would open it.  They did, but this was really inconvenient.  One morning we went down to the pool (around 10 am) and there were no clean towels, just a pile of dirty ones.  The windows do not open so there is no fresh air at all, and the room was only moderately clean (at best) . -newline- The pool, whirlpool, and fitness center were all fine.  The fitness center is not big but it looked clean. -newline- They also advertised that the hotel was in "walking distance" to several shopping centers.  One of them (Westfield) was not even opened yet - it's brand new, and only about half the stores are finished so there is not much there.  The other (Howard Hughes Center) was ok and in walking distance, but if you choose to drive there they also charge for parking. -newline- I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they are doing business at one of the corporate buildings in the immediate vicinity.  It's just not a fun or scenic place to be for vacation, especially with all the variety LA has to offer.
