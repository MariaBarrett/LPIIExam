ReviewText:I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Century Plaza. Wow! What a fantastic hotel. As soon as I arrived at my room I was shocked at how clean everything was and how comfortable the room felt to me. For my entire vacation I felt as if I was sleeping at home. The beds were even great! The staff is friendly and they have convient transportation options to the surrounding city.

ReviewText:Hotel has been totally renovated and rehabbed. The common areas both inside and outside, especially the pool area are a great plus adding a more resort-like feel to what is essentially a business/corporate hotel. -newline-  -newline- Room was spacious and well furnished--every room has a balcony. I could see the ocean--nice plus. Modern decor was very upscale, and an enjoyable environment. -newline-  -newline- Staff provided excellent service, when checking-in and out. Appreciated staff referring to me as "Mr. (last name)" whenever I interacted with them, whether to pick up my car from valet, or call for room service.

ReviewText:Location, location, location. This hotel is I the center of the west side of LA and you may easily access anywhere else in LA. Big comfortable rooms and an amazing staff of very friendly people will make your stay great. It is not the scene of the W Hollywood, but is comfortable and friendly.

ReviewText:the hotel is nice overall however needs extra attention is some areas.I was room moved the first morning because me and my husband woke up with bites on our legs.Eventhough we were offered lunch vauchers , we never got them.Room service delivered only my husbands breakfast and it took an additional 20 minutes for my order, so we did not have breakfast together,our jelly was opened and used by a previous person...gross but the server did not apologize or offer as a discount for the inconvenience.I asked numerous times for bathrobes and I never got them:( I purchase a bottle of wine and I needed a cork opener, but i got a beer opener .

ReviewText:Location was perfect. Close to Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, UCLA and freeway (405). Room was clean and comfortable.  Concierge service was great for finding activities in the area, getting tickets, area restaurants and directions anywhere. Not too much drawer space to store clothes, though. Did not like the $24 for parking every time I had to use the rental car.

ReviewText:The hotel food was poor. While the breakfast came with the room the food was undercooked or stale. The day we checked in they had a letter saying the water would be turned off for part of the visit but didn't let us know until we noticed the letter. The staff offered minimal help and when we went to have a drink in the hotel bar located in the mail lobby on a Saturday night in the lobby at 9:30 they said it was closed and had to go to the night club with the loud music and would give us a chance to sit and talk to friends. Then when we went to leave there was a marathon going on outside in the street and we were unable to leave until they cleared out. Another thing it would have been nice to have been told before by the staff.
