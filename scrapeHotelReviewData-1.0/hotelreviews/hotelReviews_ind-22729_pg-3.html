ReviewText:We stayed here to attend a concert at the coliseum. Since many places were booked for the show and the xgames, this one was reasonable and close enough. The taxi ride cost almost $30, but we were able to take the bus home which worked out nicely. The hotel was just fine for the price. Rooms were clean and comfortable. My sister mentioned being able to hear the guys next door late at night but I slept -newline- Through it. Thankfully. Staff was friendly. The garden was nice.

ReviewText:I found that the staff was unfriendly. Because we did not book the room directly with the hotel, they were not accommodating to my request. When I originally booked the room through Hotel Club, I specifically requested for a king bed, however when i arrived at the hotel, they gave me a room with two double beds. when I spoke with the hotel in regards to this, they specified that because we used a third party vendor, we get what is available at the hotel. If that is the case, then why do did the website make you choose the room type? All in all, I pleaded with the front desk person who finally switched our room. It was just a headache trying to check in.

ReviewText:I enjoy this hotel and love being in Japan Town. The only draw back is Valet Parking, it takes forever, they need another person on week-ends. But the location for me is very rewarding for my business. I can meet my guest and they enjoy the gardens and even a Starbucks on the property!!

ReviewText:Hotel shuttle service for 3 mile radius was convenient. The hotels lobby was beautiful. The only problem was the room didn't look like their website, and there was no pool. I was looking forward to eating at ALL of the restaurants in the hotel, but only the same two were open the entire time we were there. The customer service was great.

ReviewText:Kyoto Grand is located on 1st Street and LA Avenue downtown.  It's 5 blocks from the Disney Music Hall (amazing!) and the Music Center where the LA Opera performs, as well as several theatre companies.  Many art galleries are near-by as well. -newline-  -newline- The hotel was clean, well-kept and the parking valets quick and friendly.  Room was nice, with a large, comfortable bed. -newline-  -newline- Downtown itself can be quiet at night, but LA Live is five minutes away.  We liked that downtown was a little quieter.  We could head out to Hollywood to party and have a good time and then come back to downtown and relax in a more low-key environment. -newline-  -newline- LA has many, many places to party if that's what you're looking for.  It also has plenty of out of the way spots for "adults" to have an evening of causual elegance. -newline-  -newline- We enjoyed our stay in LA and would stay at the Kyoto Grand again.

ReviewText:The Kyoto Grand Hotel was beautiful. I had a very nice room. I wish I had a nice view though. Like one that is facing Japanese plaza. I loved the bed. It was very comfy. The garden was so pretty too. This hotel have pretty much everything.. as in a car rental service, resturants, bar, fitness room, salon, and etc. The only problem I had was the fridge did not work and the sink in the bathroom did not drain well at all. But then it didn't bother me much.

ReviewText:I was in L.A. to visit friends and I loved the hotel. Great Asian feel, beautiful botanical gardens, the room was very nice and big. I had a corner room with a queen bed, couch, mini fridge, safe and walk in closet. It also had an amazing downtown skyline view. staff was amazing, room service was quick and the food was good. doormen were perfect in opening doors and getting cabs for me. Definitely will stay here again.
