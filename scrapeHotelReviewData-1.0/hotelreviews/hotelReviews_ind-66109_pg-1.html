ReviewText:Horrible experience. I entered my room and there were dirty dishes in front of my door. My room had not been cleaned and the furniture was ripped. So I got a new room. All was well until it was time to go to sleep. I turned down the bed and there it was...a larvae encrusted bug. The manager came to the room and said, "oh it's ok, it's cereal." No, not ok. I left the hotel and they charged me for 1 nights stay. However I did not sleep there. Never again! Completely unacceptable and disappointing.

ReviewText:The room was lovely and the staff was incredibly curtious and helpful. The hotel provides valet parking and there is minimal wait time after requesting the car. This will be our go to LA hotel.

ReviewText:The customer services alone was a 5 star experience. The rooms are very comfortable and clean. Each evening we found our room turned down and fresh towels in place. Slippers were left at the bedside. We ordered room service in the mornings and everything arrived pipping hot and exactly on time. Food was excellent. We could not have been happier. Highly recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:Close to all fun things, shopping and dining were all 10-15 or less away. Very attentive staff. Breakfast was great and quick. Even came to room while we were out to add ice to our champagne bucket so it would be chilled upon our return. Quiet rooms, comfy beds. One gripe, there was black mold under the clear calling in the shower. Easy I think to fix, not sure why it's not.

ReviewText:I enjoyed the four days and nights I spent at the Sofitell Hotel very much. My accomodations were very satisfactory , commodious and comfortable. The staff were all friendly and ready to help with any problem. I appreciated their attention because I am old and disabled. Everyone I spoke to on the staff seemed to know who I was. The restaurant served tastefull, satisfying and nutritious food, well prepared and well served. As far as I am concerned, I looked forward with great anticipation to eating my breakfast there each day.

ReviewText:The Sofitel in LA is by far one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. It has a great location and the staff is very friendly. I would suggest this hotel to anyone looking to stay in LA.

ReviewText:I had meetings I needed to go to down the street. I would suggest that this would be the best hotel to stay in the area. It's new and modern .

ReviewText:Love everything about the Sofitel except that the beds aren't the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Also, it'd be nice to have the option of snacks that aren't needing to be ordered via room service or taken from the very high-priced mini bar. Also, be prepared to bend down if you're taller than 5'6" for the low shower head. Other than that, a fabulous experience!

ReviewText:This was a great place to stay - the staff was extremely helpful and pleasant. They all went out of their way to greet you and help you. The rooms were nice with a great view of the Hollywood hills and extremely comfortable beds. It was well located for anyone interested in good food and LA shopping and sightseeing. I can't think of a thing to criticize.
