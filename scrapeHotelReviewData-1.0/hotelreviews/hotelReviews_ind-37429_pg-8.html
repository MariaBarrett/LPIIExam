ReviewText:Top quality hotel, very restful. -newline-  -newline- Nothing to watch on TV unless you ordered a pay per view movie. -newline-  -newline- Super long walk to the parking garage, and you have to walk all the way thru the lobby to get to a separate elevator.  The elevator was kind of creaky and unpredictable. $18 a day for parking, WOW! -newline-  -newline- Everything inside the hotel was extremely clean and the gym was great! The pool and spa were clean and in good working order. -newline-  -newline- You only had access to the hotel food, no pizza flyers or directions to any nearby alternatives. Research alternatives beforehand if you're on a budget.  All in all the hotel itself was worth the hotel fee's, but not the parking it was a rip off. -newline-  -newline- Snobby check in staff, they waited on a walk in person even though I'd been standing there and they were already checking me in.  I was made to feel unimportant.

ReviewText:Easy to get the the Rose Parade.  Nice place, would go again but be aware if you have a car there is a parking charge that is a bit steep.

ReviewText:Great service, polite staff, and great location just north of downtown LA made this hotel a perfect choice. Drive times to LAX vary with time of day and traffic -- just plan ahead!

ReviewText:My girlfriend and I took a celebratory trip to the LA area for the weekend.  The hotel building itself and the individual room were nice; the bathroom was especially spacious compared to most hotels which was appreciated.  We asked for one thing while staying there and the service was poor.  We wanted 2 wine glasses and a corkscrew since we brought some of our own wine on the trip; they charged us for the glasses!  This is the 1st I've ever heard of such a thing.  The $1.50/glass wound up being over $7 after the delivery charge, service charge, and tax; and all that occurred after the front desk woman said she'd have it sent up, which she never did so we eventually noticed nothing was coming up.  After calling down, it still took them 20 minutes to bring up what we asked for.  That definitely put a damper on the hotel experience, as did the parking garage being poorly run as well.  Overall, the physical building was nice, but don't expect good service and if you do ask for something, be prepared to pay for it in time, money, or both.

ReviewText:This hotel was fabulous, offered friendly service and we especially enjoyed the $5.00 drinks/appetizer happy hour in the lounge. The room and bathroom was lovely. -newline- My only complaint was the $18.00 parking fee. I cannot say I've been to a hotel that did not validate for self-parking. Otherwise, good trip, fabulous accomodations.

ReviewText:A great hotel.  Prices in the giftshop were outrageous, but I had to keep reminding myself we were in LA.  The staff forgot our wakeup call.  Glad we used our phone alarm clock too.
