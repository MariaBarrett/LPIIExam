ReviewText:My son and I had an opportunity to make a quick trip to LA. The hotel was great, and the trip was a success. We used the hotel limo service to/ from the airport, and for a r/t to Dodger Stadium. It was great!

ReviewText:First off, Los Angeles, as far as I can tell, is a big sprawling mess, so there may not be a good location that puts you near everything. The Hilton in Universal City is reasonably close to the sights we wanted to see, such as Universal Studios, Beverly Hills, and Griffith Park. -newline-  -newline- The hotel room had a king size bed, a desk, refrigerator, and other amenities. The bathroom was a shower/bath with sufficient space that two people could share it without any difficulty. There is a programmable wall safe to hold valuables. -newline-  -newline- We were able to make transportation arrangements through the hotel for pickup at the train station upon our arrival from San Diego, and for our departure via LAX. The hotel concierge will also make arrangements for tours, and will give you comparative prices for transportation to popular destinations. Most cab rides to will cost around $25-30 or a bit more, but the hotel can also make arrangements for a limo or a van to carry you around town. -newline-  -newline- There are a couple of restaurants which are moderately priced, about $15-20, not counting drinks. There is also a coffee bar that serves danish and gelato. -newline-  -newline- The best restaurant we ate at while in LA was in Universal City. This was Tony Roma's a chain devoted to ribs.

ReviewText:This property has very nicely appointed rooms, but the hotel itself is very average. The layout of the lobby is terrible. Guests have to pass through the middle of the hotel buffet to get to the parking elevators. The guest room elevators are incredibly slow. Housekeeping did not refresh toiletries, which meant we ran out of shampoo on the second night. On the other hand, the room was large, bright, and comfortable, albeit awkwardly shaped. I had to add an extra night when I checked in and that required about 20 minutes of processing because they had to set up a whole new reservation (couldn't just add onto my existing night). The crowd here is what one would expect in Vegas: loud and ready to party. That's not the hotel's fault - it's a consequence of proximity to Universal Studios theme park - but be aware that if you're looking for a serene setting, this isn't it.
