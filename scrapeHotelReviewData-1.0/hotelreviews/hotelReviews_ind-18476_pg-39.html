ReviewText:Long lines for check in.  Key didn't work and it's a LONG walk to the rooms.  Beds were OK but rooms were dark and ugly. -newline- Would not stay there again!

ReviewText:Hotel is close to Manhattan Beach, for Starbucks lovers there is one located right across the street. Hotel is dated, but one cannot beat the price. Check-in process was time consuming, long line and only two front desk staff working.

ReviewText:I used this hotel for a weekend in L.A. to watch a college football game at USC. This hotel was great as it was just about 1 mile from LAX (airport)The aiprot provides a free shuttle to and from the airport, bonus. The rates are incredible reasonable/low. Room service is really affordable and all the other amenities available to the traveling guest are right there at the hotel. At this hotel you can relax at a full bar and grill and even rent a car on location! I felt like I was at a budget resort of some kind, unbelieveable friendly staff and clean comfortable rooms. I think I'll be staying here everytime I come to L.A. as there is no better deal for all the things that you get staying at this hotel, wow!
