ReviewText:The service at the Hilton Checkers was fantastic.  The concierge, housekeeping and restaurant employees could not have been more helpful.  We will definitely come back to stay at Hilton Checkers LA if/when we ever come back to LA!

ReviewText:Went to see everything you can possiblly think of. 6 days is quite a long time, yet it is needed to see everything. Clubs at night/morning, sight seeing during the day.

ReviewText:We got a great price for this awesome hotel.  We just stayed for one night because of a concert we were going to.  The room was great and the location was nice.  LA Live is walkable.  They had a flat screen TV in the room... though no HD channels which I thought was strange.  We usually travel with a DVD player but this time we decided not to.  I wish we had because unlike a lot of hotel rooms, this one actually had hookups for the DVD player to the TV.  The bathroom was lovely and a 2 headed shower was great!  The bed was comfortable and the linens and pillows were top notch.  Make sure you valet park because the lot next door will charge you over $50.

ReviewText:If using this hotel while on a business trip to downtown L.A. the location is great. Proximity to the area we visited not as close as described by mapquest, considering highway traffic time. -newline- The fitness center was adequate. The room was comfortable for 3 adults. However, housekeeping did not supply sufficient towels. We had to ask each day for additional towels. The mattresses and pillows were too soft for our taste.Parking expensive, but other reviews alerted us to less costly alternatives. -newline- Staff was friendly and responsive. We did not eat in hotel.

ReviewText:In LA for the weekend, including Sunday afternoon concert at the Walt Disney Concert Hall, up Bunker Hill 1/2 mile from the Hilton.  Also walked to Fashion District and Staples Center and had easy access to Dash buses and Metro rail for Chinatown and Union Station/Olivera Plaza.  The Hilton staff was attentive and professional. -newline-  -newline- Check in with my Orbitz reservation was a snap.  Check out was equally easy.  Enjoyed using the fitness center and rooftop hot tub/pool.  Orbitz offer of third night free made it the best bargain I found for a hotel of this high calibre. -newline-  -newline- The Hilton Checkers has a nice low-key intimate boutique feel, compared to the grandiose, busy feeling across the street at the Biltmore Millenium, where we ate one evening.
