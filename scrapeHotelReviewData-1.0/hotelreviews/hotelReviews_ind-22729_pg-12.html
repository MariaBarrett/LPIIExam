ReviewText:This is a nice hotel. It is very clean. I was impressed by the garden on the third floor. It is good to walk around. The home has pretty much every thing that is needed. Want to use the Internet for a short time, you may want to use the computer in the business center, which is free for 5 minutes usage. It is good if you just want to do a simple google map.  The breakfast in the restaurant is quite expensive. A cup of tea would cause more than 3 dollars. Other than that, the hotel is quite nice and comfortable.

ReviewText:This hotel was very nice. Check in was quick. The Hotel has a asian theme. Dont miss the Gardens on the Third Floor. Beautiful. Had dinner in one of several they have on the premises. Good Dinner and Service.  Located very close the Disney Concert Hall. City Hall is just around the corner.  You will be have to pay for parking either 24.00 for self-park or 30.00 for valet. Seems kinda high, but it is Downtown LA.

ReviewText:Location is great because we wanted to be near or in Little Tokyo.   The area seemed very safe and secure even at night to walk around.  It was also convenient to get on the highways.      Room was comfortable and kept clean during the stay.        But I was surprised that hotel does not provide 1) real glass instead of flimsy plastic cups and 2) yukata or bath robe, particular for a hotel who caters to Japanese guests a lot.

ReviewText:The Kyoto Hotel & Gardens was quite a pleasant experience. The front desk staff was exceptionally helpful with directions and recommendations on restaurants and places to go like The Getty museum and other places (LACMA. It was a five minute walk to the metro. Our room was comfortable, always clean, and had a great view. We would recommend this hotel and will stay here in again this spring when we return to LA.

ReviewText:Once we got into our room, the AC was off, it was extremely hot.  When they would change the linens, they would cut off the AC!  The ice machine was broken on one floor.  The pillows were 12x12 and very uncomfortable.  The ironing board/iron was extremely difficult to work with...the breakfast buffet was 19.99 PER PERSON!  The location was accessible to the DASH or the bus line, taxi's were available.  My suggestion: bring some oatmeal to make in your room using the coffee pot for hot water and bring some fresh fruit and yogurt for the mini fridge.  The music that was played in the lobby was obnoxious...remember I was in the lobby for sometime before I got my room key.

ReviewText:The hotel employees were very nice and friendly.  The room service for the breakfast was bit expensive, for typical breakfast.       We had a smoker's room.  Whem opened the window, but found there was no screen to protect bugs from coming into the room.  I got bitten and had to close the window. But when windows were closed, ventilation was so poor I asked my husband to smoke in the bathroom.  I think it could impove it's ventilation.  But overall we had a pleasant time at the hotel.

ReviewText:Finding a decent hotel at a reasonable price in a major city is always a challenge. Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens is good value for money. Our room was sparkling clean, spacious, and nicely decorated. We were especially taken with the Japanese Garden and the first-rate fitness center. I would have been nice to have free Interent. Overall though, it was so pleasant, we look forward to staying here again.

ReviewText:Hotel is well used,  My room carpet was very stained, The AC does not have enough volume to cool the room.  The Breakfeast buffet was good but not worth the $20.00 dollars changed.  Nothing near by to go to eat.  Little Toyko was a disapointment
