ReviewText:The motel was conveniently located near all of the LA tourist attractions we wanted to visit. Our tour was scheduled at the front desk and the tour bus picked us up in front of the motel. The room was comfortable and very clean with a nice TV and decorated well. The staff was friendly and accommodating. We would recommend it as a moderately price and clean, comfortable place.

ReviewText:I stay in and around LA every other week. Mostly in different spots throughout the greater LA area. This was one of the better rooms I've stayed in. Spotless and the room was good sized. Really comfortable. The room didn't have a microwave like the Burbank Best Western does, which is a nice convenience, but overall the room was bigger and cleaner. -newline-  -newline- It is literally right off the 405 freeway. That could be a good or a bad thing. The good is that freeway access is super easy. The bad is the 405 is a parking lot most of the time.

ReviewText:nice place, clean and friendly staff. great location and no bad surprises. beds were comfortable and big. if you are cold in the nigt you may want to take your extra blanket- two sheets that are offered to cover are pretty thin. -newline- It is not the hotel's fault but website had it posted as Free Internet access and Free Breakfast- there is no free breakfast there. But i don't think that was their fault. they did not know it was posted like that. -newline- Nice place- if I go there in the future, I will stay in this hotel again.

ReviewText:The bed was comfortable and clean, the bathroom was clean, and the staff was willing to help us with anything we needed. The rooms were cleaned perfectly and they folded our clothes the only problem was the shower was slightly clogged and filled up with water if you spent 10 minutes in there. Other that that perfect.

ReviewText:The picture online did not match the real thing. Also, have free breakfast instead of sending is to Denny's for every meal!

ReviewText:We stayed in room 401, just so you know. -newline-  -newline- The room was spotless, the caulk in the tub and bathroom was pure white - it was like it was recently renovated and perhaps it was. The bed was comfy and the sheets were clean. I felt comfortable sleeping there. The towels were kind of old and did not have that smell that the towels in top hotels do but they were clean. But the price was absolutely right. FREE WIFI!!! We'll be sating there again next week. The attached Denny's is a bonus for breakfast and the money you save more than makes up for the lack of continental breakfast when you consider you can get a real breakfast there.

ReviewText:The hotel was fine. I like the double sinks. Sometimes they were a bit tight on the towels. Everything else was fine. Beds nice. Good morning coffee.

ReviewText:Small room, but generally clean and comfortable. Very friendly front-desk staff made up for a room that leaned toward two-star quality.
