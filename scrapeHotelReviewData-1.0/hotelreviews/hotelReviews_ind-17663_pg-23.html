ReviewText:Ahead from expectations, comfort excellent, facilities and cleaning as being at home. Will recommend this hotel to any visitor in LA, close to main attractions, freeways and still noiseless and cozzy.

ReviewText:Located in the between freeways in Los Angeles this location in Sherman Oaks is excellent and surprisingly the traffic sounds are very diminished in the rooms. -newline- The rooms are extremely clean and modern and also includes a nice writing desk, desk chair, Wifii and good lighting. They have a gym open 24 hours and a heated year round pool. If your not out of your room by 12 sharp they do get kind of pushy, even if you are shlepping your luggage down two floors. Except for the fact that my travel plans were not faxed to the motel for confirmation and spending four hours at the front desk waiting for it, all accommodations were lovely.

ReviewText:This is my second trip to LA, and it was my best stay in CA. Definitely recommended, clean and roomy place. Parking lots are for European cars though. For same price I would stay there.

ReviewText:Will be back next month, the hotel has exactly what we needed and the check in process was really simple. Also, it was interesting to find that the pool was open and warm during the winter.

ReviewText:I was impressed by how well the staff responded in a wind storm that knocked out the power to the building where my room was...last week during LA's terrible winds. They were great...very helpful and moved me to a nice room w/ power. Offered me a free meal in the restaurant. I was there 3 days and always felt cared for. The place is in a fairly noisy congested area near the 405 freeway and yet the rooms are pretty darn well insulated...you can hardly hear the traffic. I would say again.

ReviewText:This was a good hotel at a decent price in a convenient location. The room was clean, everything worked, parking was free, and it was convenient to both the 101 and 405 freeways. The 24 hour Dennys located in the hotel parking lot was also a nice plus, although there were plenty of other places to eat nearby. Desk staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful.

ReviewText:I have stayed at this hotel a few times. It is clean. It can be a little noisy just due to it's location.
