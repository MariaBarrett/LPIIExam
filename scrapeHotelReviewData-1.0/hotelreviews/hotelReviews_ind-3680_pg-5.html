ReviewText:Great experience! The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The location is superb! Tons of things to do to keep you busy. I stayed for IMATS at the convention center. The only thing I didn't like, were the paper thin walls. I could hear my neighbors coughing at night, peeing and closing drawers. Make sure you get a rate with the free breakfast. The rate for two people is $38!!

ReviewText:The Hilton Pasadena was a nice property...I slept well and the staff was nice/accomodating. The parking garage was under construction, but they did give us valet parking at the same rate that we'd have paid in the self parking garage. Overall, this was a nice place to stay for a night. Eat breakfast (or grab a pastry) at the Heirloom Cafe & Bakery while you're in Pasadena...it was AMAZING!!!

ReviewText:It took about 40 minutes to find our reservation from [...].  The electrical fire in the hotel happened when we were in our room and the fire dept. was called BUT an alarm was not sounded and we not notified, most likely the law was broken here.  We were just stuck in our room without use of elevator.Business office expenses were too high.  Room was ok but shower head was broken and the hook on the bathroom door was falling off. Pricey parking fee was charged.

ReviewText:A nice, well-run hotel walking distance from the Paseo Colorado Mall in the heart of Pasadena.  The staff is very friendly, they have a first rate bar in the lobby, and a Starbucks, too.  I stayed in what they billed as the Deluxe King Bedroom, which turned out to be quite small, with an even smaller bathroom that I could barely move around in.
