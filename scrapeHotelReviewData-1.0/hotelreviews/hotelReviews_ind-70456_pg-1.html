ReviewText:I have stayed at this hotel before and this time was not nearly as good. They gave us a room the was old and a view that was terrible. There was construction going on the entire night and it was so loud. My first experience here was great, but if you stay in the same room I did this time, its not worth the money.

ReviewText:Room was a little small, but not bad. The location can't get any better if you want to experience Hollywood. The hotel bars were top notch, with talented mixologists.

ReviewText:My fianc√© and I arrived on Tuesday around 2pm and were met by valet. We unloaded our luggage which included one suitcase and 2 paper grocery bags that included some snack items, 2 odawalla juices and 4 bottles of beer. Per the valet we were not to worry about our luggage that once we get checked in our luggage will be delivered to us in our room. After checking in we went to room 835 and found a very lumpy bed and smaller then what we expected room. We went back to the front desk and asked if there was a different room that we could have for the night stating that we'd pay the additional $50. After waiting in the front for roughly 20 minutes we were taken to a cabana room to take a look at it. We decided to pay the extra money and took room 118. We asked that the front desk make sure that the valet knew that we had been moved to a different room. We waited over an hour and still had not received our luggage. I called down to the front desk and was advised that our luggage would be delivered shortly. We then received a call from the front desk as they could not locate our luggage. I advised that we had originally been in room 835 but moved. He stated he'd find our belongings and get it to us quickly. After receiving our belongings we unloaded the grocery bags to find that our beer and juices were missing. I went down to the front desk and double checked the car to ensure that the valet hadn't put the beers in the car and they were not there. They compensated us with a few drink vouchers and corona's. The rest of the evening was filled with the people upstairs dropping things on the ground around midnight. Wednesday morning the cleaning crew was making a ton of noise right outside of our door. After checking out we stood in front waiting for the valet to bring us our car for more then 20 minutes. The car was just a few feet from us so we just asked for our keys and walked to the car. The overall stay was disappointing due our items being stolen in the beginning. This caused an uneasy feeling the entire stay that a staff member could come into our room and take any of our belongings. Although the staff compensated the stolen items we really feel that there should have been better compensation due to the invading of our privacy.

ReviewText:It was located next to all the tourist attractions, so if you like that stuff or just need to cross it off the bucket list it is a nice place.

ReviewText:I stayed at this hotel on a business trip. I would not recommend it for business travel because it was very loud at night with receptions and events being hosted there. However, it would be a fun hotel to stay at for vacation. They have outdoor movie night at the pool and the bar by the pool seems to turn things into a night club atmosphere during the warm "summer" nights. -newline-  -newline- Also, the air conditioner was so loud that I had to turn it off at night to be able to sleep - and I'm the type of person that can sleep through just about anything. -newline-  -newline- Bottom line: If you're going to Hollywood for fun and don't plan to sleep much anyways, this hotel is perfect for you. If you're traveling for business or with kids, stay away!

ReviewText:Got a very quiet room facing Hollywood Boulevard, but woke up many times with the loud (and old) air conditioner switching on and off. -newline- Tiny bathroom with no pressured water, no space to keep my travel kit or a cup for the toothbrush. -newline- Poor channel selection on TV. -newline- Room was clean, but for the price I would expect a lot more.

ReviewText:Excellent location and facilities. Great pool party on weekends. Don't get a room near the pool if you don't want to stay up late.
