ReviewText:The hotel itself looks unpretentious and provencial, but when i went in , it's like coming home,the service is great, i love the water dripping, the sounds made me relax, lobby area is amazing and so cozy for me while i am doing some internet surfing.My room got the best view by the pool and i swim everyday, saw butterflies flying in the garden,they take care of the garden all day,it's like a real hacienda, with everybody attending you,great place ,all hotels are great too but i feel more comfortable here.oh yeah , the parking is affordable.

ReviewText:This hotel is very close to LAX and the price was GREAT. Parking was reasonably cheap. The room was very nice too. My only complaint would be the lack of a thermostat in the room. We turned the fan off, but it got too hot - so we then had to open the window to cool off - but as I already said - this hotel is very close to LAX - so we did hear the planes. But the for the money - we'd definitely stay here again.

ReviewText:We liked the proximity to LAX and the shuttle service.  It is a busy hotel that provides a resting spot between flights or for a short visit to LA. The attached restaurant is also decent and the complimentary breakfast is more than adequate.

ReviewText:Very convenient location.  Just a few miles from the airport.  They have a shuttle to LAX but it took a while to get going (they diverted the shuttle I was waiting for to go a mall instead of the airport). -newline- Restaurant choices around the hotel is not that great, unless you have a car.
