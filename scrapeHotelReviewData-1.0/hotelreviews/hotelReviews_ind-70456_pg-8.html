ReviewText:We live about 40 miles outside of LA but my partner had to be in the city for three days to attend a conference, and I had to be downtown for rehearsals two of those nights, so we decided to make it easy on ourselves and stay in town. It was a good decision and we really enjoyed the hotel.  It has a rich history, a beautiful lobby, nice rooms, and is very convenient to the Metro and the Hollywood area.

ReviewText:The Chinese and Kodak Theaters are across the street. We were on the 10th floor with a perfect view of the red carpet premiere of A-Team. Valet was super slow. We waited more than 20 minutes for our car. Apparently, they only had one valet attendant.

ReviewText:Even though it was an overnight stay, the hotel is all Hollywood, with portraits of people like Steve McQueen, Jack Nicholson shown in their daily routines.  The hotel was absolutely gorgeous and glamorous.  Will go back again for an extended stay next year or sooner if something comes up.

ReviewText:This was our first trip to Hollywood and the Roosevelt Hotel was in a perfect position close to everything. The room and service were all more than satisfactory. We are happy to recommend it.

ReviewText:We stayed at the Roosevelt to attend the Chelsea show at the Gibson Theatre. This redone classic Hotel was enjoyable, even though the [...] reservation was lost. There is a lot of street noise from Hollywood Blvd so I would get a room in the back side. There is no space in the bathrooms was our only complaint...that's the down side of an older hotel. Great pool area with hip young adults.

ReviewText:I am a married, adult law student in my mid 30s, and I stayed at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on my recent trip to L.A. -newline-  -newline- The reason for my trip was twofold. I was to have a meeting with my new business partner and friend regarding the company we just started. Also, I have 4 very old and dear buddies that I went to college with who live in Hollywood as well, and I hoped to combine a business trip with pleasure by reconnecting with them over cocktails. -newline-  -newline- This was to be a very special occasion for both myself and my old pals as none of us had seen each other in many years. After college I went away to law school while they moved off to the west coast to chase dreams, and now that we've all become successful in those pursuits we were eager to sit around and swap our respective stories and I'd hoped to provide the hosting location via what I thought would be a swanky hotel with an atmosphere that the entire group could appreciate. -newline-  -newline- To give you an idea of the group's make-up, I'll just say that two of my friends are now working for two of the major broadcast networks in executive positions where they work in the production of two different prime time TV shows, and the rest are successfully established in the music business, so all of us had tons of exciting stories to tell and were excited to get together for the purpose of doing so. Consequently, I was looking for a hotel that could offer us a hip, centrally located spot to meet/eat/drink.  I also wanted to stay somewhere that had tons of amenities, gorgeous architecture, and a rich history. I must admit that if these were the only criteria that mattered, The Roosevelt would've certainly more than fit the bill. -newline-  -newline- Ironically, all of us had plenty of money to spend on expensive food and beverage service which is exactly what I was in the market for, but sadly the behavior of the Roosevelt's staff forced us to spend it elsewhere. In general the employees at The Roosevelt were so unbelievably rude, unhelpful, and inexplicably conceited that their lack of professionalism and total absence of anything approaching hospitable service, ended up rendering the property basically unusable as anything more than a place for me to sleep at night. Considering my experience, if I had it to do over I'd have taken up one of the many offers to stay in a friend's guest room in lieu of ever entering this hotel. Typically I am the kind of person who is uncomfortable with such an imposition even with close friends and family, but that kind of experience would have been far more comfortable than any of the time I spent on The Roosevelt's property. -newline-  -newline- I was surprised to find that after ten p.m. (and often during the day as well), there was no way possible to ingress or egress from my particular room without encountering a rude, snarky, and accusatory member of the hotel security staff. Security at The Roosevelt, apparently, consists of well-dressed gentlemen with secret-service-style earpieces whose job it is to interrogate guests as to where they are going each time they leave or return to their rooms while simultaneously making sure they don't feel comfortable anywhere near the pool bar area. -newline-  -newline- The first day I was there, after checking in and going out to have some dinner, I returned to the hotel with 3 friends. Our plan was to stop by my room to drop some things off, then we were going to head to the bar at the pool for a bit. Unfortunately, our plans changed after the glorified hall monitor on duty insisted that he search each of the bags that each of us were carrying as if we were common criminals attempting to smuggle narcotics through customs or something. He explained to me, after finding a single bottle of alcohol that I had purchased on our way back, that the hotel had a policy against "outside alcohol", and that this was "typical policy at most hotels". Having previously managed an oceanfront resort, I found that information surprising, but I totally complied without so much as politely que...

ReviewText:Hotel is very cool but very weird.  Reminded us of a David Lynch movie set.  Dark and moody.  We did get lost a few times in the hotel.  Loved our stay. We stayed in a Cabana Room that overlooks the pool.  We had a balcony view of the pool and Tropicana Bar.  Only complaint would be that the room was very dark (not enough lighting) and we had to track down ice (no ice machine on our floor even though the hotel directory said their was ice on each floor).  We ended up going to the bar to get ice and were told we have to call front desk and have ice delivered to our room.

ReviewText:Even with all of the pre and post Oscar activities happening at the hotel the staff couldn't have been more friendly and helpful.  We arrived in the morning and were able to get into our room without waiting until 3pm.  My only MINOR complaint was the lack of complimentary coffee in the room.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
