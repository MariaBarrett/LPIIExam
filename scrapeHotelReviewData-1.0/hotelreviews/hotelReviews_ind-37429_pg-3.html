ReviewText:The hotel was beautiful and the staff was pleasant. Everyone from the concierge, parking attendants and housekeeping was welcoming and accommodating to our request. Parking was a little steep ($18/day) but peace of mind is worth it for a rental. Disappointed that WiFi was not included. If McDonalds can offer free WiFi so can the Hilton. I refuse to pay an extra $12.95/day. There are a lot of nice shops and restaurants nearby (on Brand St.). Itâ€™s about a 20-25minute drive to downtown Los Angeles and Hollywood. Further then I wanted to stay but the savings is worth it. I recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:I have stayed here many times and appreciate the comfort, service, the relative quiet and the gym. I'm not sure if this is allowed, but rooms ending in "25" are corner rooms and are ideal. It is the room I ask for each time. The gift shop was able to hold a LA Times paper for me daily, which was appreciated. Easy freeway access.

ReviewText:nice hotel but one cup of coffee is $3.41 and there is no bathroom fans, refrigerators or microwaves. if you want extras like frig. or microwabe it costs a bunch of money per day. I will not be staying there again. can get better bang for your buck

ReviewText:The hotel and rooms were nice and I lked the location of the hotel. What I didn't like is the additional charges when I got there, that I didn't know about in advance. The hotel parking was $18.00 per day, a roll away bed/cot was an additional $20.00 per night. Most hotels don't charge for these services. Additonally, the room service was quite expensive and there was no refrigerator in the room. I won't be staying at this hotel again for these reasons.

ReviewText:The checkin person was friendly up until she noticed I had booked through orbitz. Additionally, parking was $18 a night. I didn't have time to look around much, but it seemed there was free street parking one block back.
