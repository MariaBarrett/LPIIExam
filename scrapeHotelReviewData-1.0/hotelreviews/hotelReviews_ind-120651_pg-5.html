ReviewText:Checked in for only 3 hours but was overwhelmed by how friendly the staff was...  Ordered room service at 1:55 am for an alcoholic drink and it was delivered promptly and with a smile.  Desk was very accomodating... checked my bags during business hours.  Only problem was parking garage was reeeeally far from hotel.  And expensive.  Valet was $35... self parking $24.  Ridiculous.

ReviewText:i really loved the hotel and the room, the private balcony is really cool, friendly staff, if i visit LA again definatly i'll go to the same hotel. i went once to other 4 star hotel but the room wasnt that luxury comparing to Hayyat Grand. the only disadvantage was the breakfast, it was expensive !

ReviewText:A family member (adult) was injured when the umbrella by the pool chairs blew over and onto her. Some umbrellsa had been closed, some had not been closed. The heavy metal center support rod hit her in the neck and shoulder fairly hard. That incident marred an otherwise enjoyable stay. -newline-  -newline- As for missing items: a coffee pot in the room would be a welcome addition. It is irritating to have to get dressed and go downstairs to Starbucks for a simple cup  of coffee. -newline-  -newline- The mini-bar "program" of "you touch it - you bought it" is irritating. Such an extreme measure is insulting to guests.

ReviewText:The hotel was beautiful - I'm surprised [...] got it for me so cheap. My only surprise was that there is no parking for the hotel. I needed to valet my car with them - that costs $35/night. Perhaps this is in keeping with other area hotels - I am not sure. Hope it helps someone out to know up front.
