ReviewText:Not bad for the price.  Stayed overnight since the hotel was hosting an exam for work in the morning.  Room was small, but very clean and quiet.  Check-in was a breeze, staff was friendly.  Location is next door to a Carl's Jr and across from Sizzler, Ralphs supermarket, and a bunch of other eateries.  Bed was too firm, but pillows were plush.  Amenities were inconvenient (i.e. ice machine was in a different wing).  $5 seems unnecessary for parking in the lot; it didn't seem any more secure than parking on a side street.  Overall, a pleasant stay.

ReviewText:This was a great location for us and the staff were very friendly.  We would have liked to have a coffee and some little thing to munch on before leaving.

ReviewText:Very friendly and efficient staff.  The airport shuttle was a God-send and the room was clean and quiet.  Dinner in the lounge was tasty, well prepared and inexpensive.  I can see why many people on the shuttle were airline staff.  They know a good thing when they find it.  Very latino in decor and amenities so it was quite a change from what we see here in Montana.  The little patios outside with benches, flowers and fountains were nice on a winter's evening.  One even had a lit fireplace in the corner.  Overall, I liked it a lot and will go back when the need arises.

ReviewText:My hotel room was on the fourth floor in the main building. It had a balcony with table and chairs and was shaded by a beautiful tree which created amazing privacy. It was a very quiet and restful place to stay. The other things I liked about the Haciendo were the convenience of walking to restuarants, shops, the wonderful neigborhood area behind the hotel for morning walks, and the spacious lobby and adjoining courtyard to sit and relax.

ReviewText:We stayed there for 3 nights, my father was a good customer in the 90's for more than 10 years and recommended it. The staff was always friendly, the food was pretty decent, but the hotel lacks character, its getting dated, we were told its been under renovation, the rooms are very clean though...We would go back hoping at least the same srvice.

ReviewText:Found the reception staff to be most unhelpful when we asked directions and for advise on transport, they couldn't of cared less.

ReviewText:I was disapointed in the rooms on our first stay, on our return after we requested to stay in the newer wing the rooms were much better. -newline- When I booked the rooms with you I didn't know there would be a very old section.  But I found out the hard way.
