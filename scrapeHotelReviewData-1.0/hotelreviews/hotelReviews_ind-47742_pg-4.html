ReviewText:Our room overlooked the Walt Disney Concert Hall which delighted us every time we looked out the window. Although traffic from the Getty to the hotel was congested, getting to our other destinations was not. Valet parking was wonderful and we did not have any wait for our car longer than 3 or 4 minutes. Our encounters with the staff were all positive.

ReviewText:The rooms are poorly designed. Not enough lighting, and no lights near the closet or dresser, which caused for some difficulty in selecting my clothes. -newline-  -newline- The bathroom is large enough but there is zero counter space for toiletries and no place to hang your towel near the shower. So I had a sopping wet experience out of the shower to the towel bar. -newline-  -newline- The closet bar came up to about .3 ft so that meant my dresses and long coat had to be draped over a chair. Not sure the thought behind that design. Besides, other than the hooks on the inside bathroom door, where the robes were smartly being advertised for purchase, there were no other hooks in the room. -newline-  -newline- Overall, the lobby is nice, but this hotel missed some basic, but important details that left me dissatisfied. -newline- And for the price....this experience really was annoying.

ReviewText:The location of the hotel is good, it was in the middle of everything, it seems like it only took 15 mins to get to anywhere i needed to go. the staff are good.. the room service however, i was not impressed.. the first night we stay there, we order breakfast in the morning and it was good. soo we decided to order again, so in the middle of buttering my break my boyfriend notice that the bread has mold on it.. thats not what i was expecting from the 4 star hotel.

ReviewText:Everything was OK but this guy at front desk (12/19/12 morning) telling me what to do with my credit card at the check-out. I spent almost 3,000 in LA on gifts and tours using my credit card, the same I used when checking-in when I realized I was close to my credit limit I went the night before leaving town to change the card on file just to be sure and do not get any fee for exceeding my credit line, I gave them my debit card and told them to please do not charge anything else to my credit card, not even the $40 dollars per day for parking. Next day when got the final invoice I realized they actually did charge my credit card in one of the two rooms. I went to front desk to fix the problem asking what should I do if the bank charges me for exceed the limit on my credit card and this "employee" instead of yes we made a mistake we will cancel the charge to you credit card and will charge your debit card and if there is any fee (usually $35) we will credit it back and sorry for the inconvenience... He started to raise his voice saying well, we charge only one of the rooms but it works in both ways you "should not leave a card without funds on file" obviously everybody on the line was listening, you may understand how I felt, I raised my voice too and he just typed something in the computer and with an arrogant tone said I just canceled the charges to one of the rooms, that will be "enough" to cover any fees from your bank...It was like he was giving me charity or something, I just left. REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE!

ReviewText:The staff at the Omni were great. They made my family feel so welcomed. This was my first time to LA so I wasn't familiar with the area but the Concierge was able to give great information on tours, sites and restaurants. Also, the room was great...it was a perfect size for 3 people, the view was awesome and it was so clean. The only complaint was with room service. The food from the overnight menu was great but dinner was not good at all.

ReviewText:Fast check-in with reservation. The room was very spacious and lovely. Bathroom was beautiful but the shower needed better cleaning between the tiles. That and the fact that you have to walk through the valet entrance to get back in late at night are the only downsides to this hotel. I will definately be back and recomend this hotel to my friends!
