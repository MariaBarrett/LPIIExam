ReviewText:Very weird to navigate, many stairs, pleasant feel and handy for visiting UCLA or Beverly Hills. But not sure I'd stay there without a very good deal.

ReviewText:I can't believe this hotel is only three stars. I would choose this hotel over 4 and 5 stars any day (and I did, I chose not to stay at the Beverly Hilton because it was too "Beverly Hills" for me). I plan to make this my hotel for all future visits to LA. I loved the beautiful elegance. Every room is a suite. Outside my door was a tropical garden and fish pool. Close by was an intimate jacuzzi that was not next to the swimming pool which made it perfect for quiet dips. The outdoor swimming pool was surrounded by a beautiful garden with classical music pumped in. Wireless is available for $10 a day (worth it). There's a spa and a hair salon. I was in paradise. The staff was spectacular. Treated me like a queen. The restaurant is small and intimate, but elegant and the food was great, though the menu is limited. I travel fairly often and I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I just loved it! I was on business but I sure wished my husband was with me.

ReviewText:I loved the hotel it's so calm and quiet, the location is a bit far from the Rodeo and the price of car parking is expensive.

ReviewText:Great value for a little taste of charming retro Beverly Hills glam. Stayed in a junior suite. Big room with fully stocked kitchenette. Spotless. Plush spa robe & slippers. Super friendly, accommodating staff. Fabulous bed.Excellent food. Downsides: No room service after 9 PM. Paper-thin walls. If you are a light sleeper, this is not the place for you

ReviewText:We stayed 4-nights at the Beverly Hills Plaza. The check-in process went smooth and we were upgraded to a larger room (I assume because it was a very quiet time of year). -newline-  -newline- The hotel is located on Wilshire Blvd which is SUPER close to the "action" of Beverly Hills but far enough away that you can relax, too! -newline-  -newline- Parking is expensive but convenient. Instead of using valet and having them expect a tip each time they get your car, right around the corner is a private, gated parking lot. Swipe your card and you get instant access. It is safe and secure. -newline-  -newline- The cleaning staff didn't impress me but we did always have fresh towels each afternoon when we returned. The rooms were a decent size and it was nice to have flat screens in the rooms to relax and catch up on the day. -newline-  -newline- The restaurant on site is expensive .. yes, even more expensive than the places to eat IN Beverly Hills. It is convenient, however, and the food was okay. -newline-  -newline- Overall, we enjoyed this hotel and plan on staying there again in the future.

ReviewText:Beautiful place. There are a lot of stairs- beware. Room was large and staffed with clean towels during room service without being asked. Would stay again

ReviewText:A colleague and I found ourselves in LA for three days on business, but with a very sparse programme of meetings. The hotel was a great place from which to work, sitting beside the pool.

ReviewText:People were wonderful. Waterfalls, classic LA interiors and quiet too, while being an intimate setting on the outskirts of Beverly Hills, not too far from Westwood and UCLA.
