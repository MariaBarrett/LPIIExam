ReviewText:The hotel is incredibly beautiful, but is missing amenities that are now standard at most Motel 6 facilities. For example, the hotel charges for WiFi, has no honor bar or refrigerator in the room, and only has ice machines and pop machines on every other floor. It was a bit disconcerting, to say the least. -newline-  -newline- However, the staff was very polite and worked hard to be as helpful as possible.

ReviewText:Wonderful architecture and preserved the feeling of the period. Surprised by high ceilings and size of rooms. -newline- I had an inward facing room that had a generator nearby - I couldn't see it but it was like a semi truck idling outside my room all night. I ran the air conditioner (also noticeable) to "tame" the other noise. I was only staying 2 nights so did not ask to be moved. Wonder though if it was my discounted rate that got me that room. The only other item to mention is the elevators are very small and be prepared to wait 3-5 minutes.

ReviewText:The lobby was spectacular. It made me feel like I was in a 1920's movie. Bathroom was very dated but It goes with the charm of "old hollywood vibe". WORSE PART WAS THE $40.00 DAILY PARKING. If I would have known, I would have taken my $230.00 elsewhere. I ended up paying the "savings" on a daily parking rate. 5 days, $200 in parking fees is BOGUS AND INSULTING.

ReviewText:The architecture is amazing! Be sure to check out the early 20th century tile pool in the basement of the hotel. It used to be a "gentleman's club!" and it reflects some wonderful examples of the artful California tile work of the 20's. " We could practically hear the ghosts of Hollywood's Golden Era toasting and boasting it up with each other wrapped in towels!

ReviewText:Valet customer service and instructions needs a lot of work. Also, the rates are insane! $40 a night for valet is too steep. Internet access is $10 a night. Most hotels have complimentary access. The hotel rooms look much nicer in the pictures than they are. I recommend remodeling the bathrooms in the hotel rooms.

ReviewText:Hotel was clean despite its age. Architecture was very interesting. Amenties were fine. Just wish internet was included. In this day and age, it should aways be included. Even the cheap hotels provide free internet!

ReviewText:Located in the heart of downtown LA, this 1920's era hotel is extravagent in its public areas. The room was clean and comfortable, but needs updating. Tiny bathroom. Bathtub wouldn't drain, so filled while I showered. No hand towels or washcloths, only 2 bath towels. Very poor channel selection on TV. -newline-  -newline- But for downtown LA, the price was right.

ReviewText:Requested late ck in and they terminated reservation. When they reinstated room downgraded and desk attendant acted like 'oh well' they should have told you after certain time no holding. Bed hard and uncomfortable. View a wall. Overpriced for what received. I stay downtown LA alot and the worst service. I will never return!

ReviewText:Comfortable, spacious, although the noise of the a/c fans outside the window of this interior room made a lot of "white" noise. Good food and service in restaurant and cafe at hotel. Easy walk to many theater, museum and music venues. Adequate complement of restaurants and shops in immediate neighborhood. I would book again when I had a big enough budget.
