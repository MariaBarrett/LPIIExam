ReviewText:We had easy access to friends and cultural events on this side of town: Pasadena, Getty Center, Skirball Center, Brentwood, Coldwater Canyon.  Rooms are comfortable if a little subdued in style. It would be lovely if the Amarano had a pool.

ReviewText:The hotel seems a bit understated from the front but when you walk in it excudes luxury. Our room was very spacious with a very comfortable king size bed. The eye pleasing colors in the room were very relaxing. The room was very quiet and the drapes kept the room dark for sleeping. The large flat screen TV made it very enjoyable to watch. It was nice that the hotel had a towncar to pick us up at the airport and drive us anywhere within a 3 mile radius. The bar had a beautiful fireplace and plenty of places to sit as a couple or as a group. We would definitely stay there again!

ReviewText:Nice little hotel with clean large rooms.  Had a loud party in next room, but they were on their porch area, when they went into room noise was quieter. Wasn't told about the valet only parking with a daily charge of $29 plus tax.

ReviewText:We really like this hotel, the rooms are nicely decorated and very clean and regardless of the time that we show up, they always have the room available and they allow us to check-in.  It's comfortable, convenient for where we need to be (freeway entrance and exit are near by)and the lobby and bar area are like a cozy living room.

ReviewText:The hotel was very nice- we felt safe, comfortable and it was peaceful.  We would go back again.  The location is not bad- you are close to Hollywood, and not far from downtown.  Bea bea's for breakfast seems to be a huge draw- it is right across the street, along with a cute Grocery store- you have a kitchenette in the room- so take advantage of that!!

ReviewText:We only had one night here due to our schedule, but would have loved to stay much longer -newline- The hotel was wonderful! -newline- Without a doubt, the most beautifully appointed room I have seen, and the largest by far. -newline- The roof-top hot tub and sauna were fantastic â€“ we spent a very relaxing evening enjoying the view -newline- The staff was marvelous, extremely friendly and attentive, though completely non-intrusive -newline- When we return to Burbank there is no doubt that our stay will be at the Amarano

ReviewText:Came in town to see Ellen Show.  Would have helped to have individual maps with lists to places to go to give out to patrons.  Wish we had more time to go do other things, but it was a very positive experience overall.
