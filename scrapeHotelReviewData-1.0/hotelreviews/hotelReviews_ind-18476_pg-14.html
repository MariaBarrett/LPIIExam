ReviewText:Hotel is obviously an older hotel (creaky floors!) with few in room conveniences (no coffee or refrigerator mini bar) . Room was clean and bed was comfortable. Restaurant was so-so. Biggest plus is closeness to LAX and free shuttle to airport. Would recommend for convenience if have a very early flight out of LAX.

ReviewText:The hotel is very close to the airport and easy to get to. The rooms and restreant were very clean and the staff was very acomedating. Although parking costs extra it is right next to the hotel. I am sure we will use this hotel on our next trip to LA

ReviewText:This is a great hotel if you need a place to stay close to LAX. There is a free shuttle. The beds are comfortable and the showers are great after a long Trans Pacific flight. There are plenty of food choices within walking distance and a great shopping center as well!

ReviewText:This is my second visit to Hacienda Hotel. -newline-  -newline- First time was in July (stayed in south tower). -newline- Second time was in November (west tower). -newline- Chose it because of its proximity to LAX. -newline-  -newline- I like the decor of this hotel. Also like the little diner that's right next to it (Currasco's). -newline-  -newline- I have two criticisms of the hotel. Both of which I only encountered on my second visit (november, west tower). -newline-  -newline- First, the room had a musky, moldy smell. I asked to be moved but other room had same problem. I turned on a/c to vent the room. Returned to a cold still smelly room. -newline-  -newline- Second, there was no heating. After turning on the a/c I needed to heat up the room. Called the desk. Was told its an old hotel, uses a central boiler, boiler takes 10 hours to heat up, and they haven't turned it on yet for the winter season. Requested blankets but they never came.

ReviewText:we spent 21 nights here. its not a five star hotel and reminded me of mexico. what one has to consider here is what they are getting for there money. it is far better value for money than any other hotel I know in the lax area and I have no complaints
