ReviewText:I do a good amount of traveling. This is not a 3 star hotel. The room was very unclean, to say the least. Location was fine and so was the staff. Overall an unpleasant experience. Very disappointing.

ReviewText:I travel to LA on business and the hotel is located really close to the LAX. Some of the facilities, especially hallways, elevators are pretty outdated. However the room inside is spacious and clean. Very old TV, limited channels. Some options to eat in the proximity but mainly fast food. Restaurant in the hotel is expensive and not so good.

ReviewText:To be fair, I only booked this hotel because it was a decent price, and near where I was taking my test. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful when I arrived. Nice shuttle driver, friendly front desk staff. -newline-  -newline- My problem was mostly with the room. It smelled of urine and old cigarettes as soon as I opened the door. I asked housekeeping if she had any spray for the smell. She apologized, said many of the rooms had a smell so I didn't bother to ask for another room. The white comforter on the bed had stains so I immediately took it off. Later that night someone on the building was prank calling the guests trying to get their personal information *scary. I then received a wake up call (that I didn't order) at 4am. Terrible since I needed my rest for my test. -newline-  -newline- Again, lovely staff, but icky room.
