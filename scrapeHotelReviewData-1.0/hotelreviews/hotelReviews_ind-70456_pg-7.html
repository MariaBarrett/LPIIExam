ReviewText:We used this hotel as our "base of operations."  It is conveniently located in a great part of Hollywood with easy access to all the great sites (e.g. Gruman's Theater, the walk of fame, etc.) as well as easy access to freeways.  There are plenty of coffee shops nearby for breakfast.

ReviewText:My daughter was there for auditions.  It was located in a fun part of town. The service was great. The room was really comfortable.  Important items were on hand which was great- make-up mirror, iron, hair dryer, great quality shampoo and conditioner and body lotion, q-tips and cotton.

ReviewText:Very poor overall experience with the Hotel Staff to provide room that was contracted. No attempt was made to tell us of their inability to provide the contracted room, as if they were trying to do a bait and switch. Room was not the pool view as specified in the reservation and it was also next door to the restaurant. The room air conditioner was broken and the room was over 80 degrees at the time of our late check in. The night manager took no responsibility and we left without a word of regret from the staff. Bad, very BAD

ReviewText:This is a refurbished hotel in the middle of Hollywood Blvd.  As a New Yorker, it was a good stay in a warehouse, loftlike designed hotel.  The poolside was noisy at night and the 20somethings were all excited, tipsy & happy, however I was pleased that the front desk put us on the side of the hotel where we didn't hear the noise.  The suites were well appointed and roomy.  Great for a small party with our frineds.  Food expensive.  Staff was wonderfully pleasant and helpful.  We were there for a weekend wedding and fullyu enjoyed ourselves.

ReviewText:This was the second time I stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt.  The first time was over a year ago and I had a lovely time (girly weekend, birthday party pool-side).  This time at the Roosevelt, it was the worst hotel experience of my life.  And I have travelled all over the US and Europe, so that is saying tons.  We stayed in the "new" poolside rooms.  The rooms are now trashed, scratched floors, chipped paint, stained carpets in the hallways.  The pool is now open to any random person who comes in and gets a drink at the bar.  After the randoms leave the pool, the lounge chairs are left dirty and nobody is there to clean up.  I thought we could get some pool time in during the AM with other real guests of the hotel, but both mornings (Friday and Saturday), work men were trimming the palm trees around the pool!  My lovely swim was covered with palm tree sawdust.  Coming back to the hotel at night (after 2am), I had drunk random people pushing me as I tried to pass by the pool to my room.  Sad that the Roosevelt has to be so desperate to make money.  Oh, and no free internet???  Seriously?

ReviewText:Overall, It's a great place to stay, but there were a few minor problems, [...]. The room itself was Okay, not the best but Okay, for a junior suite, you have a huge walk-in closet, but the bathroom was really tiny, especially for a suite, it kinda makes you question about how they utilize the space in the hotel. Our air conditioner did not work, We had to call someone from Engineering to come and fix it, it was the circuit breaker located in our closet that was turned off, that controlled the air conditioner.It was really noisy in the room, due the party / dj / club scene downstairs by the pool. I am thinking to myself, what if we upgraded to a room by the pool.After checking out, it took me and wife awhile for us to get our car from the valet, even though I called ahead of time. It was interesting, we were waiting in the front, I already handed my ticket to a person and we noticed our car parked in the front. It took more than 15 min to finally realize the person in the suit had our keys the whole time, no one informed us.Overall, my experience was good nor bad, some improvements could be made or done, but historic landmark with a great view.

ReviewText:Iconic hotel in a great location and a fantastic price. -newline- Stayed at the Roosevelt for 3 nights with 3 friends in May and we all loved it. Our room was big enough for all of us (and our luggage!), modern and recently decorated. Walking distance to the majority of Hollywood sights - although LA is a driving city. The pool area is lovely and the staff were helpful.
