ReviewText:We came from Alabama to the BCS Championship game. (We won!), and the hotel's shuttle picked us up at Bob Hope Airport, without us having to call for the shuttle.  The staff were all really nice and helpful, the hotel was very clean and comfortable, and the location was really quiet and restful.  We were very comfortable walking the nearby streets visiting the variety of restaurants and businesses located right outside the door!  There was nothing that was a disapointment other than leaving the Rose Bowl and walking almost 2 miles uphill to try to find a cab or shuttle to take us back to the hotel after the ballgame.
