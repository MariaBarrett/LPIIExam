ReviewText:A pretty good quality hotel with a touch of class. The rooms are comfortable and the beds and bathrooms were both very nice. Only small gripes were with some of the service (especially from the concierge who seem to expect a tip everytime you ask them a quick question). It could also be considered pricey for some but I would probably stay here again as location is pretty much central in the Beverly Hills/West Hollywood area and enough places to eat and shop nearby.

ReviewText:I stayed here during my LA visit to see family and friends over the Thanksgiving holiday. I chose the Sofitel after staying there a few years back when my company set me up there on a business trip. It was nice then, but it's even nicer now, after its renovation. Friendly staff, nice quiet rooms with updated everything. This is one of the few hotels I've stayed in recently that's had one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in! The lobby is ultra-slick with black and mirrors everywhere. My only gripes: no coffee maker in the room; no refrigerator other than the mini-bar; the bathroom sink in my room had slow drainage; at $29 per day for valet, I wish there was self-parking, at least at a lower rate - it's would also be nice to be able to retrieve last minute items out of your car without having to wait for the valet to retrieve them for you. Overall, though, very nice!

ReviewText:The staff here were exceptional and very very polite.  They addressed any requests we had immediately.  The location of the hotel opposite the Beverly Centre was convenient for shopping.  We were in LA without a car but the bus stops/lines near the hotel were convenient to get around.  The concierge was helpful giving us clear instructions on how to travel around.  I would definitely recommend staying at the Sofitel.

ReviewText:Front desk service was superb, with lovely upgrade, late checkout and lots of service and attention suitable for a woman traveling alone.  Bell staff also excellent.  The restaurant was also good, though not great mostly because of one slacking waiter.  Otherwise, the food was fine and other staff very good.  They were very accommodating at an off hour as well.  The hotel has been redesigned and is very contemporary and has and evening "scene".  This leads to rather noisy halls -newline- with people coming and going down to the bar but all settled down by 11p.m.  Also, do not get a room on the street as the traffic is noisy.  Overall a very good bet with great service.
