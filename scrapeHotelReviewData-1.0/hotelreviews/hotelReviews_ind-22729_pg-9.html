ReviewText:It was nice but not great. The pictures on website are better telling. The gardens are best thing about the hotel. The parking should be included in my opinion, to expensive. If you want to eat, there is some great sushi spots down the street on 2nd. Also there is LA live about a mile down to figoura,they have great food.

ReviewText:Nice stay for the week end in downtown. Close to the metro and bus stations. Walk distance for Little Tokyo, restaurants and MOCA. One hour trip or more in bus and metro to the Getty Center and beaches. The hotel is clean, comfortable, no noise, has free 10min internet on buisiness center. Great pillows!!! We use to travel very often, and we enjoyed staying there.

ReviewText:I was pretty scared about staying in this hotel!  I read a ton of bad reviews from other people that have styed here!  What's wrong with you guys?!?! -newline- This hotel was awesome!  It was close to everything we wanted to do, the rooms were very clean, the bed was comfortable (we both like firm mattresses). The food in the restaurants was awesome, the staff was very polite, and the decor was really amazing in the lobby! -newline- We will definitely stay there again if we go back to L.A.  And I would recommend it to anyone I know that's going to L.A.

ReviewText:The best thing was the location.  It was close to where we needed to go.  The local Jazz radio station, The Wave, hosts nightly live jazz groups.  I was able to look out my window and see the groups and hear their perfomance.  If you don't like jazz, too bad because you can hear what's going on from every room.  The parking is $24 per day if you are a guest and $30 if you are there to visit one of their resturants.
