ReviewText:Web showed a beautiful looking hotel, well this is a very old hotel and the room was small, dirty and had no A/C or Heating. First night we were so hot and the second night was freezing cold. Bathroom was extra small. (Could not close bathroom door if someone is sitting on toilet) -newline- The fan vent was solid black with yuk. -newline- When I ordered on-line web stated queen bed, called to comfirm, hotel stated they had not queen bed rooms, so I call orbiz and they stated that I would get two full size beds instead, but upon arrival they told me that I booked into a queen bed room and they had no knowledge of the two full size reservation. So neither the hotel nor Orbiz knows what they are talking about. VERY Frustrating!!!!!!

ReviewText:Very clean rooms and comfortable beds for the price. The friendly staff helped me get checked in quickly even though I arrived at 1 am. The open courtyard and pool also appeared appealing, but I was only at the hotel for a few hours, so I did not have time to investigate further. -newline-  -newline- The free 24 hour shuttle service runs every 15 minutes. It also has a number you can call to let them know at which pick up location you are waiting if you need.

ReviewText:They were swamped at the front desk with 2 people working.  Took an hour to check in.  Over all the hotel was good.  Super close to the airport.

ReviewText:Just spent the night to pick up some friends coming into the airport from Australia and need a place to sleep. The room was clean, staff was friendly but I think the room was a bit over priced and had to add an extra $5 for parking.

ReviewText:My husband and I were staying the night after a long flight into LAX from overseas. The hotel shuttle was prompt once we called and requested a pickup, and our room was older style, but clean, comfortable and quiet despite the many planes flying over. We checked in early, which was no problem for the friendly staff. There are many latin decorated nooks and courtyards that make this hotel very different from the local chain hotels. The hotel is situated directly across the street from over 5 cheap food options, however, we decided to dine in the hotel's restuarant which had decent food and great service (much faster than the local IHOP). Overall, a restful stay. Would stay again!

ReviewText:It was close to LAX but the room was smelly. The floor was not level, slanted. It was clean and the staff was very nice, the elevator was very small.  OK for the price.

ReviewText:Needed a hotel near the airport for my last night in town.  Room was clean and suitable for the one night stay.  The price was 50% off the original price so I couldn't complain.  Lobby is beautiful and friendly front desk representatives!  Additionally, 24 hr shuttle to the LAX was a plus!
