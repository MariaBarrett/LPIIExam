ReviewText:From the moment we rolled my broken wheelchair into the lobby we were treated like we were the in the penthouse. The staff were on it and friendly. We had never stayed in a hotel this nice and were surprised at what your money got us. The room was plenty big enough for my oversized scooter and the beds were soft and plush. From the doorman letting us in to the manager letting us make emergency repairs to the bartender why whipped up something special for me it was a experience. To top it all off we werer just minutes from Club Nokia where our concert was. It was outstanding. We will be back.

ReviewText:always good - easy to downtown work location -newline- parking is too expensive so I park around the corner at another hotel and pay one fourth the price. No in or out priveldges with this other parking situation, but definately a cost savings. While the Biltmore is a good value, the parking destroys your budget of economy.

ReviewText:To begin the staff was very excellent and helpful. Usual at hotels the staff don't show me the hospitality that the biltmore staff did. Valet was speedy and a fair price and room service had a nice filet mignon steak. Location is nice in the heart of dowtown not far from the staples center and the housekeeping did a nice job with my room everyday.

ReviewText:Downtown LA is not my favorite place to stay, but this hotel gets the job done. It's old, historic and beautiful inside. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Some parts of the hotel could use updating, but nothing was overly terrible. The driver at the hotel is very helpful, as walking around downtown LA on weekends/evenings isn't always the most pleasant.

ReviewText:This is the only hotel we stay in when we are in Los Angeles and we always enjoy our stay there. Our daughter had her meet the groom party here before her wedding and also stayed in their bridal suite the night before the wedding. All her out of town guests stayed at the millennium and were transported to her wedding destination from there. It was a most memorable occassion in 2009. We stayed previous to this time also and will stay again and recommend it to friends.

ReviewText:Opulent and with an unexpectedly colourful history which I found fascinating. Very close to LA attractions and the staff were attentive and friendly. The only downside was the lack of hotel mini-bar and room service, which is probably due to the age of the hotel and room configuration. But the elegant and beautiful surroundings more than make up for this minor inconvenience.
