ReviewText:Location Location Location - couldn't get better if you need to be in downtown LA. The lobby / the restaurants / the service is impeccable and you feel like a King walking in - until you reach your room. For a $250 - $300 plus per night hotel - the room was small / bathroom was small / iron was OLD / ironing board was stained / bathroom fixtures and shower were super OLD and cruddy. The bed was AWESOME though. I would pick a newer Marriott / Hilton in my next trip to LA.

ReviewText:This hotel is horrible the staff was great in friendly , but the overall hotel itself HORRIBLE!!!!! I don't even write reviews but this I had to tell. First thing we checked in and our room was on the fourth floor as we were walking towards the room in I notice the carpet is burgundy with burgundy tape to match then we get to our room is basically in the dungeon no nice view or nothing so I call down in ask can our room be switched and they said yes. So I'm thinking ok this should be better by looking at the carpet in the new room on the third floor. But no it wasn't so once in the room we look around of course until I find a lifestyle (condom) behind the desk area then the remote batteries hadn't been changed in ages if ur looking for ammenties their aren't any the bath tub and the bathroom sink takes water forever to go down the hotel need to be updated it's still stuck in the 1920's I will never stay there again....

ReviewText:I stayed here once before and loved it I never had a single problem. This stay however was very different and I don't think I would like to return. The first night I was there I made sure as to check in early. This was because I knew I wasn't going to get back until late and wanted to go straight up to my room. I went up to my room to find out that the room was occupied by another person and the keys didn't work. I wasn't to mad so I went back to the lobby to advise the staff of the mistake. They insisted I had a guest there when I was traveling alone so I was weary. Finally after an hour of checking in for the second time, they made a mistake because the other guest had same last name as me. Thinking to my self the verified my name had my license and my credit card all with my full name and still made this mistake. Anyway I was very tired and not in the mood for arguing so I took the sencond room and went up to the hotel to sleep. The next day I went out earily and room service had fixed up my room. When I climbed into the bed to lay down as crazy as it sounds there was a razor blade in the bed. I was shocked I picked it up and put it on the end table next to the bed. I checked all around for where it could have come from and i could not find the source. My only explaination was that during cleaning it came from some equipment they used. Just be forwarnd about this hotel there service is very spotty to say the least.

ReviewText:Hotel was not what I expected and the hotel is in need of a slight renovation. The only this I liked about my room was the bed...of course the fact that my room window was facing a brick wall did not help matters. -newline-  -newline- The location is great if you plan to ride the bus/train during a visit because parking a vehicle here will cost you $40 a night which is a little ridiculous...decent hotel but there our much better ones in the area.

ReviewText:From the moment I arrived until I checked out, they treated me like a queen!! The Doorman was amazing, he took good care of me and made sure I was getting good low prices for taxi's. This great reflection of Old Hollywood is located just minutes away from just about anything. There is even a tour bus that picks up at the Hotel and brings you back. Great!!! The spa was wonderful and everyone at Aveda Spa located in the Hotel were amazing not only are they great at what they do, they made me feel welcome there.

ReviewText:The Biltmore is a wonderful old hotel. All the rooms are well kept. But it is the public rooms, the lobby, bar and ballrooms that are special.
