ReviewText:I only booked the room for 1 night for a good nights rest before traveling.The Staff was great and very helpful. My room was clean and fresh,the only thing I was missing was a microwave. That might have made it better oh yeah the parking was down the street my Grand mother had a hard time walking but all in all I would definely recommend this Hotel to a friend

ReviewText:Second time staying here. Free trolley to the airport that leaves twice an hour. (I used last time, not this time, its along one street to the airport) -newline-  -newline- I enjoy staying here and will probably stay additional times whenever I need to stay near LAX. -newline-  -newline- Good quality linens, carpet was clean, no odd smells in the room, bathroom is more spacious then most.

ReviewText:Pretty average hotel room, but the courtyards are better than expected for the money.  The hotel wifi works there too, so I could get my work done next to a fountain instead of a room, which was nice. -newline-  -newline- The parking lots, however, were somewhat inconvenient.  Both were located away from the hotel, and I had to make several trips across the street with luggage.

ReviewText:The room was new with 2 queen beds. The bathrooms were clean and looked regularly maintained. The breakfast could have been better but the ambience and the look and feel of the room was good. Overall, a very satisfactory experience for the price. Would come back for another stay.

ReviewText:We found the hotel to be quite good for an overnight stay prior to going on a cruise.  Shuttle service & breakfast the next morning were appreciated.  We were 2 couples meeting at the hotel.  Across the street was a nice grocery store, complete with a good wine selection; we were able to carry on board 2 bottles of wine to consume in the cabin so we took advantage!

ReviewText:Overall, good value for the room rate that I paid. Basically just a  room to sleep in after running around LA visiting. Good location next to freeways/airport and shopping.
