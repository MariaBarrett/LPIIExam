ReviewText:Disappointed to find out parking is $40 per night.  This wasn't mentioned in the reservation process.  And that internet access is $10 per day.  Restaurants are good but expensive.  Rooms are large, but bathroom is tiny and needs renovation.  Public areas are elegant, but the guest rooms feel old and tired.  Time for an upgrade project.

ReviewText:Stayed 1 night.  The lobby is an incredible example of Art Deco in the grand Hollywood style.  The room, however, needs a little updating to keep up with the lobby.  The TV (tube style) was in armoire and made passage from bed to bathroom troublesome.  Bathroom had fairly new marble, but tub needed refinishing and the shower leaked.  Such a beautiful property...hope someone will care enough and have the resources to restore the rooms to original beauty.

ReviewText:My 17yr old daughter & I stayed here to attend the symphony up the street at the DIsney Music Hall. Our stay was very nice, our room was nice and clean, beds were comfortable, the staff was very helpful. We asked for a taxi and [...] (the valet) asked us where we wanted to go and he sent us in the hotel town car instead and they picked us up when we were ready to come back a few hours later-- it was great!! Parking in the hotel lot is $40 a day, BUT directly across the street from the Olive Street entrance is a parking garage you can use and it's only $15.40 for overnight use-we parked there with no problems. Everything is close by, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Hollywood, shopping--great location, I recommened it.

ReviewText:I liked the hotel very much, especially the design of interior. It was old but very elegant and luxury. -newline- The one thing I didn't like was their washroom. The washroom was really hard to use and very small. Overall, it was nice trip and nice travel package!

ReviewText:IT WAS A GREAT LOCATION. WE NEEDED TO BE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS THERE.  THE HOTEL WAS VERY ELEGANT LOOKING, BUT ONCE WE GOT INTO THE ROOM, THE BATHROOM FIXTURES REALLY MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE IN A PUBLIC RESTROOM.  THE BATHROOM/SHOWER COULD USE MUCH UPDATING. AND THE TV ALSO NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. THERE WAS NO MINI REFRIGERATOR. THERE WAS COMPLIMENTARY COFFEE THOUGH. WE JUST STAYED FOR A DAY, SO I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THE AMENITIES.  THE ONE THING THAT WE DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE HOTEL OVERALL IS THE $40/DAY VALET FEE! I WISH I CHECKED FOR THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN THE DEAL BREAKER TO STAY AT THIS HOTEL.  SINCE IT WAS ONLY A DAY, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT FOR SOMEONE STAYING MORE THAN A DAY, I'D RECONSIDER THIS PLACE.

ReviewText:The service was excellent.  They upgraded our room at check-in with a simple ask.  The hotel is in an excellent location and the place itself is a historical landmark.  Beautiful and classic decor.  My only (small) complaint is that the hotel looks a little worn in the halls and rooms.  Very clean though.

ReviewText:It was our first anniversary and when I told the man at check in we got up-graded which was awesome! The room was lovely and delightfully old-fashioned which I wanted. The view was great as well. Bed not so comfy, but the room service food was fantastic, best eggs benedict ever. Also the free breakfast on the club floor was really lovely. My husband loved the coffee and wouldn't stop mentioning it. Whole staff was super friendly!

ReviewText:Very noisy rooms. a lot of outside traffic noise and hall way noise. Not to mention that the fire alarm went off at about 11:30 pm then would shut off and start ringing again, did this several times. but there was no fire. -newline- Tv was very small and quite old considering the price of the room.  and you had to be in bed to be able to see the tv. -newline- I won't go back again. -newline-  -newline- Sasreflects in Hesperia, Ca
