ReviewText:The hotel staff were great and everything was super clean inside. The airport shuttle was always on time and the drivers were very friendly and safe. The food was excellent for hotel room service and dining. The furniture was sad though. It needs replacing. The bed was a slab with a quitted topped and the chairs all had deep wear making them less than comforable. The bathroom was tiny. I stubbed my toe three times trying to just move around to use it. The shower head was so low I had to neel to wash my hair and the warmest the water ever got was body temperature. I paid extra for a room with a view. What I did not know was that my view would be the parking garage and them into my room. Not that it matter because the windows were so filthy that you could hardly see out of them. I have certainly stayed in far worse. It fit my need, but I would not choose to return to the same hotel in the same condition for the same price.

ReviewText:The stay was great and very easy for a family with a four year old. The free parking was helpful. Only bummer was the ads advertising a pool. That was a item which attracted us. Got there and learned it was not indoor. Only thing swimming outdoors in Burbank in December were the leaves. Warning would have been nice. Could have left the goggles at home.

ReviewText:The staff was extremely helpful and friendly the minute we (we had 2 rooms) checked in until check out 2 days later. The entire hotel including the rooms were very clean but in dire need of updating. The room is not set up for business travelers. The desk doesnt' even have plugs for phones, computers, etc. The bathroom counter is very small and the lighting was so bright/harsh I felt blinded. The upside is there are many restaurants and shopping within walking distance. I would return if the hotel underwent renovations.

ReviewText:The Burbank Media Center is great. Our room was comfortable and clean. The staff was friendly. Our room had a great view, a microwave, big TV, and small refrigerator. The hotel is walking distance from downtown Burbank which has some good restaurants. I definitely recommend staying here.

ReviewText:The hotel was clean and very well kept. However I found the beds to be small and the cost for a rollaway bed was very steep!! 30.00 a day!! Oh ans the hotel gift shop did not have much and was expensive... other than that the staff was friendly and we were close to everything and walking distance from shops, restaurants & malls. Def would stay there again
