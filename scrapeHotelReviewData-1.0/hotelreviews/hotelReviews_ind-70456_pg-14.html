ReviewText:My first time at The Roosevelt Hotel was quite the stay.  It was my birthday, and I must say I did feel like a star in Hollywood.  The room was modern and chic.  The Dining options were delicious and amazing.  I was pretty disappointed though when  the pool was out of service due to an event when I checked in.  And that's what I looked the most forward to.   Other than that, I enjoyed my fun stay at the Roosevelt!

ReviewText:This hotel was great, the check in staff were extremely helpful i was impressed off the start. We stayed for 4 nights, our room was spacious the bathroom was adorable.  The Fresh product they used in the bathroom was great I wish i knew where to find it.  Bellhop was very informative.  check out was quick and easy. Right across the street from kodak theater, the Hollywood and highland center graumans Chinese theater, we have a perfect view of the Hollywood Sign. Only complaint really was there was no top sheet on the bed which was odd but they washed the duvet every day, which probably isn't to good for the environment.

ReviewText:The overall hotel was spectacular, the staff welcomed us back every time we walked through the door.  The pool is a great late night hot spot and was packed both nights we stayed. My only complaint is that the rooms were quite small.

ReviewText:The Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles is a trip back in time and place . The 1923 era  hotel is a mix of old and new , it's as if high tech meets the '20's. Young and affluent ipod people, chicly apparelled wandering amongst the high ceiling , elegantly restored hotel.       The Hotel has a beautiful pool with surrounding rooms creating a cabana-like feel. It is very pleasant to relax there , drink in hand ,  moments from the congested streets of Hollywood right outside. An oasis that is nice to come back to at the end of the day.     The counter-point to the pool scene is the main lobby.  The dark cavernous entry  is quite strange, huge , and very dark with over-sized furniture scattered about.  Another  oddity   is the perplexing floor design that  connects the mezzanine and the lobby floors. I got  lost on more than one occasion leaving the elevators and trying to find my way out.    The twenty-something staff seemed to be in a training mode . Right outside the hotel is , well Hollywood , and  that means tourists, landmarks, people watching and shopping. A great location to go to the Hollywood bowl , shop ,  beach , etc.     All in all , a great place to do LA.

ReviewText:The Hollywood Roosevelt was a great place to stay right in the middle of Hollywood Blvd.  Close to the Metro and a one-stop ride to the Pantages.  Staff were very helpful and courteous.

ReviewText:The hotel service was excellent. But it was a constant battle to get into the hotel via the entrance because of non hotel guests coming to the hotel with their cars. At times it was dangerous with them trying to exit the hotel through the entrance driveway and in turn their rude and foul language when it was brought to their attention. I am fully aware of the increased popularity of the hotel but there should be some control on non hotels guests   wandering throughout the lobby drunk and not being dressed appropriately.I believe this hotel has a lot of potential and could be a  destination spot for a select clientele if there was much more quality control.

ReviewText:My stay at the Roosevelt was great, however, I just wanted to relax by their great pool but they had a huge pool party and there was no room to sit, and it certainly wasn't relaxing.  Great hotel with a lot of character.  I will definitely stay there again.
