ReviewText:Overall, I was treated very well, after I had checked in I was escorted to the elevator and they explained all the available services in the hotel- that left a positive impression on me! Room was clean and the bed was convertible. If I had a gripe to say, is that the TV is becoming dated and the TV check-out didn't seem to work. Other than that - I loved it! Be back again!

ReviewText:This hotel was beautiful. The staff was very polite and always helpful. Rooms were good size, clean and very comfortable.  Location to Universal Studios and City Walk couldn't have been better. Walking was fine and the shuttle worked out great when it was raining.

ReviewText:The room rate was reasonable online, but once we got there everything was very expensive - for example a $4 can of sprite in the gift shop.

ReviewText:This was a fantastic hotel, right next to Universal Studios. We chose it because we were going to a concert at the Gibson Amphitheatre, and it was perfect for that. The hotel was marvellous, and the staff a bit too helpful, [...]! The room was great, no complaints. The only thing we were not happy about, was having to pay for Wi-Fi, at a daily rate, we had previously stayed at cheaper hotels and received this free of charge!
