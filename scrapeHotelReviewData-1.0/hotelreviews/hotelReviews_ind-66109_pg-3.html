ReviewText:Great hotel and location.  Beds are superb.  The hotel itself is very beautifully decorated and right opposite the Beverly Centre for shopping.  Tour buses pick up at the hotel for LA tours. -newline- Would recommend.

ReviewText:The hotel really isn't all that! The service was ok but when we arrived there was a mix up with our room so we were told that we were given an upgrade. After seeing the room my only thoughts were, "if this is an upgrade then what do the other rooms look like?" Also, our room window was right above a school and a day care and Monday morning we were awaken to the cheerful play of children. Couples, if you plan to choose this hotel upgrade to a suite or go somewhere else.

ReviewText:This hotel was a great change! We usually stay at the Roosevelt, but haven't been happy there the past couple times we stayed. The Sofitel is clean, and cozy and in a great location, which is probably the best part about it. The only thing that wasn't too great was the room size, very tiny.

ReviewText:We paid approx $360 per night for this hotel and definately got value based on the lovely room we were provided.  The Concierge left a lot to be desired, they basically were not overly enthusiastic with helping us get around.

ReviewText:This is my second stay at the Sofitel.  As a former Beverly Hills and London Hotel lodger on a corporate budget, I was completely surprised to discover this little gem in the heart of LA.  Minutes from most of the "happening" destinations, the Sofitel provides superior service and amenities at a competitive price!!!

ReviewText:This was our first visit to LA.  We had decided to use it as a stopover.  We enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel, we found the staff very hospitable, the room very clean and comfortable. We had a late dinner delivered to our room, which was not up to standard, but breakfast downstairs the next morning made up for it.  We found the hotel was a little isolated for a days sightseeing, taxis were very expensive and not helpful, and public transport not easy to use.  We did very much appreciate the holding of our luggage after checkout. Yes, I probably would stay at the Sofitel again.

ReviewText:Great location, friendly staff, excellent room. Close to everything in Beverly Hills. And you can drive from the airport to the hotel without using the LA freeways! The hotel is a bit noisy, and the room service staff needs to be trained. Overall, we will return.

ReviewText:We came to go to Rosebowl game.  Could not get in top hotels and one of the 4 season hotels recommended the Sofitel.  Great price and very nice service. They could not have been more helpful.  Even supplied a shuttle to the game.  Good room service also.
