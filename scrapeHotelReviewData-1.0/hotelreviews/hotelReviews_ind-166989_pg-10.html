ReviewText:This was an amazing experience!!! Our room was huge! It didn't feel like a hotel room. It felt more like a condo or apartment. Our room had a living room, a small dining room, and a bedroom. Each time i walked in the door i felt like i was walking into a home. Instead of the traditional hotel room( two beds..a tv in the middle... a bathroom on the right..and a small balcony!!!) it actually felt like you were coming into the comfort of a condo.  Great experience. Great staff. The pool was relaxing! Close proximity to Rodeo drive. Highly recommend this place for it's price and it's proximity to attractions!

ReviewText:Large rooms with kitchenette facilities. TV reception was not good but that was the only fault. Foyer is currently being upgraded but that was not a problem with noise or dust.

ReviewText:my sisters and I only stood 1 night we were traveling north and stopping at hotels for 1 or 2 nights at a time. We would of liked to stay longer, we did not get a chance to use any of the amenities. We did however eat diner at the hotel resturant which was very good. We loved the room and the property. We thought the location was a little out of the way from stores etc. overall the hotel was beautiful.

ReviewText:The Beverly Hill Plaza is just miles from Century City, UCLA, and Hollywood. The pool and common areas are beautiful and the beds very comfortable. The only thing I would change is the carpets and bathrooms could stand to be updated.  I would definitely stay there again though.

ReviewText:This hotel was OK.  The room was nice and clean.  Most of the furniture was nice although the coffee table was oddly not, it was old and chipping apart.  The tiling around the hotel also was off - which was not a big deal but just odd.  The staff was fine.  The restaurant closed before I got there at 10:00 PM which was annoying because there is nothing in the neighborhood to run out and get a bite at.  Overall, I give it 3.5-4.0 out of 5 stars.

ReviewText:Zeer ruime kamers en centraal gelegen. Op kleine afstand van Rodeo Drive en Bell Air. Het hotel was schoon en lag er in de zomer mooi bij. Personeel was vriendelijk.

ReviewText:とにかく階段が多くて荷物を運んだり移動するのが大変でした。 -newline- ホテルの方がもちろん運んでくれますが、かなり時間のロスです。 -newline- 階段が多いと表記されていたらこのホテルを選びませんでした。 -newline- ホテル自体は高級感もあって、緑も多く、おしゃれなのですが、とにかく部屋の壁、天井が薄いです。 -newline- 上の人が歩くたびにみしみし音がするし、隣の部屋のテレビの音、話し声まで聞こえてきます。 -newline- 自分は早起きじゃなかったので、周りの部屋の音で起こされるのが辛かったです。

ReviewText:Dommage que les chambres ne soient pas insonorisées. On entend tout de la chambre d'à coté.
