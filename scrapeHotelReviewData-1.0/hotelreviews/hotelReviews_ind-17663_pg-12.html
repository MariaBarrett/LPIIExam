ReviewText:We stayed 2 nights. We were early but they had a room ready. Felt safe in this mostly residential area on a main road. Conviently located minutes by car to many attractions. There were always parking spaces although we weren't there on the weekend. Denny's is on the property. The bed was very comfortable, the pillows fluffy. We had 2 sinks, a fridge but if you want a microwave it's $5 extra per night. Coffee in the morning in the lobby and also in room. Pool & hot tub nice, there was a small workout room. It was locked but we didn't want to use it anyway. Crews were working hard keeping the property clean. At night there are white lights around the palm trees that looks so nice. Would stay here again especially using online pricing discounts. This motel goes for a lot more for walk ins.

ReviewText:Very pleasant, comfortable stay. All staff were extremely polite. Rooms, and common buildings well kept & attractive. Complimentary breakfasts a plus- good variety & attendant kept everything stocked- could upgrade quality a bit (ie packaged mini muffins a little lame) Location great-near several coastal towns, not far from Ocean.

ReviewText:We loved it here, amazing location super close to the 405 freeway, clean enough rooms. Extremely small parking lot... Not enough spots for everyone on a busy night. Hotel staff was directing us to park in no parking zones with the mindset that if we needed to move our car they would call us... Any time of night!
