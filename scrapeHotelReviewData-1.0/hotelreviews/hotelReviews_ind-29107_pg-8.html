ReviewText:It is our second stay at this hotel. We came back because it's a great location. Tourist attractions such as the Chinese Grauman Theatre are around the corner. An outdoor mall links directly to the hotel, with tons of stores and restaurants. Great view of the Hollywood sign. Valet parking expensive at $29.00 a day but you can park your car yourself next door for $10.00 (you have to pay every time you take it out though but even if you do it twice a day it is still cheaper than valet). Convenient donut shop right across the street where we got croissants and coffee every morning to save on breakfast. Very close to the freeway. The traffic on Highland is nonstop but we never heard it from our room. We were 4 people in a room with 2 double beds. Good space, but we could use more drawers in the room. Had to call twice before housekeeping brought more hangers. Had trouble with the toilet, but they came right away and fixed it. The room had a lot more wear and tear than the room we stayed at last year (same hotel) but we found an unbeatable price through Orbitz so it was definitely worth it. Would recommend this hotel but will try something else next time.

ReviewText:The hotel was redone so it doesnt feel like an old crummy hotel, but they do nickel and dime you for everything.  They charged me twice for my one day internet, told me they would take it off, but then I had to ask the next day.  Overall, my stay was good, but I was there for a convention and not actually for hollywood.

ReviewText:We stayed recently with our two daughters (age 3 & 7) in order to attend a wedding. We got a larger room which was worth the extra money. The room was clean, comfortable and had a spectacular view of the Hollywood Hills. The only drawback was a somewhat uncomfortable pull-out sofa. Fine for kids but less than ideal for adult sleepers.      The clean and well-run swimming pool was a great family ammenity with great views. We spent hours there and it was never too crowded though my girls got a chance to meet other young hotel guests.      Another excellent feature for families is the adjoining shopping mall with good, affordable, family-friendly dining options, a reasonable amount of room to run-around, and shops for last-minute purchases. The mall was especially welcome since the in-hotel dining, while nice, was quite pricey (no more than most hotels, but it adds up when four are dining).       The staff was very nice -- from the gift shop, to check-in, to maid-service, to pool-side service.       Highly recommended!

ReviewText:The public areas of this hotel are very nice - the lobby is pretty spectacular and we attended a group dinner in the H&H Ballroom.  But it was a pretty standard room, for a high price.  The girl at check in didn't know if the hotel had cribs (please, it's a full-service hotel and they were probably 2/3 empty).  The toilet didn't have enough water pressure to flush efficiently, and the housekeeping staff asked my babysitter if we would want to change rooms (at 8 PM, when we were at dinner, and we had all the baby stuff set up all over...)  There really weren't enough towels - no extras.  The furniture was an attempt to be art deco but was not that comfortable and kind of rickety.  The bed/mattress was comfortable but the fixture squeaked when you got in and out of bed.  The view was nice - Hollywood sign and all.  But, if it weren't for our attendance at the event, because of work, we wouldn't have stayed there.  And, we won't tell any of our friends to stay there unless they want a high price for a very average hotel room.  We've stayed at other Renaissance properties, and this was was definitely not luxe, just plain.

ReviewText:The Renaissance Hollywood Hotel was okay the only thing is the bed it gave me and my girlfriend a back ache. The room was a good size.  The TV was very old and little, it was located to the side of the bed and in an old and ugly looking furniture.  The food was very good. The hotel is in a very good location.

ReviewText:Vi bodde där under renoveringen augusti 2013 och fick ett nyrenoverat rum. Mycket trevlig personal, både de som tog hand om vår bil, receptionen och concierge. -newline-  -newline- Hotellet ligger på krypavstånd från Chinese Theatre, har en egen ingång från torget bakom. Så närmre det och walk of fame kommer du inte.

ReviewText:The Renaissance is a really good and modern hotel right in the middle of Hollywood. Location is excellent for visiting The Walk of Fame, Hollywood Museum, etc but the neighbourhood is not the friendliest at night... Anyway, almost everything is a short cab ride away!
