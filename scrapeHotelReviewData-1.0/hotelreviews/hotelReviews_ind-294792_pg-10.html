ReviewText:Not for children but great location, close to everything. The lobby is beautiful and they have live bands. The staff was very accommodating. The roof top is a wonderful idea. You can swim, chill, or party all on the roof. The bathroom is HUGE which is great for sharing a space. -newline-  -newline- You can party in the hotel either on the roof of lobby and safely walk back to your room. Drinking and driving is a nonissue. -newline-  -newline- One night we had a noise problem, however the hotel took care of it immediately with no questions asked.  I would most certainly stay there again. I also would like to check out this hotel in other cities.

ReviewText:I've stayed here many times.  All too often, there are a number of people on the staff that are too snotty and elitist.  And they have a bunch of rules, like you can't take your backpack to the pool.  The location and the patrons are cool.  The staff is composed of jerks.  Stay at your own risk.

ReviewText:A friend and I were there to meet up with some friends who were staying at the Sheraton downtown.  The Standard was a great surprise!  The rooms were clean and nice.  Our stay was very peaceful and quiet.  It was in a good location making it fairly easy to get around to the places we needed.

ReviewText:While they didn't have the correct information about my stay (they thought it was for 5 nights, instead of the 6 I had booked), I was quickly upgraded to another room and booked for my entire stay. -newline-  -newline- I was there for conference at Convention Center - the hotel is 2 minute walk to Metro station and about a 20 minute walk to Convention/Staples Center.  Not a ton of dining/nightlife options in this part of town, though (although there is some very good sushi nearby).  It has a small, but clean and functional gym (interesting photos, ahem), a restaurant and bars on site.  There was an odor of cigarette smoke over the weekend (from the Friday/Saturday night crowd, I think), but there were no traces of it a couple of days later.

ReviewText:Good for singles or couples. If you are looking to "catch" then 21 to 35 year old is perfect or for the "young at heart". -newline-  -newline- Good night life- 24 hour service.

ReviewText:Overall it was a great hotel. The food was delicious. The roof-top bar and pool is amazing. The staff was very friendly.  The rooms are modern but little small for the standard room size.

ReviewText:The vibe was cool at the Standard and the hosts were extremely friendly.  The rooftop bar/pool is a hot scene and as a guest you get automatic entrance.  I went for dinner and arrived at the hotel around 11:30 on a Thursday.  There was a line to get in and they were not letting people into the bar to control the crowd.  I showed my key and got myself and a couple friends in with no questions asked.  They definitely take care of thier guests.

ReviewText:We had business meetings in down town L.A. and went to a Lakers game in the evening. - The location of the hotel is excellent. We never used our car or a taxi. Everything is in walking distance. We liked their roof-top bar for afternoon drinks and enjoyed a late night dinner at the hotel's 24 hr restaurant.

ReviewText:Perfect place for downtown LA, clean and safe area. A lot of partying at this hotel, but it won't bother you unless you insist on going to the rooftop during weekends. Great service and friendly staff. A relaxed and cool place with a sense of humor!
