ReviewText:It is very nice, comfortable, and not like a chain hotel at all.  Moreover, not only did some of the staff remember me from a visit a year ago, but I saw a number of other customers remarking about their earlier visits, recalling several staff by name. I really like the ambience of the annex, with the waterfall and large tropical plants among the comfortable guest rooms.  The remodeling looks very nice.How amazing to come to a beautiful hotel where people remember you and treat you so kindly!

ReviewText:The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and very spacious. Only compliants would be the cost of parking and the long route it took to find my room. The room had a lot to offer and it felt like a home away from home.

ReviewText:Excellent, well located hotel. Newly renovated lobby, fitness center and spa. Rooms are maintained excellently by a friendly staff. The only complaint is that their bottled water is priced way out of the market, selling at $3.75 per bottle. Bring your own. NO free whatsoever. Restaurant is great, but pricey as well.
