ReviewText:I stayed here the night before I had to catch an early morning flight from LAX and it was close to the airport and they provided a shuttle service to my terminal. PLUS -- they let me park my car there for the four days I was gone and charged me only $8 per day! That's $4 per day LESS than the cheapest public parking lot at LAX! Excellent convenience & value!

ReviewText:Older Hotel but clean. Decent value and great location. Staff seemed happy to work there so that says a lot about ownership. I'd stay again.

ReviewText:My wife and I stayed here on an overnight layover at LAX. The staff was very friendly, and the food at the diner across from the lobby was excellent. The room was clean, although it did seem old and needed some updating/repairs. -newline-  -newline- It wasn't fancy, but we got the sleep we needed and an early shuttle ride back to the airport. The Hacienda is a great option if you need to spend the night near LAX!

ReviewText:I stay at this property regularly. It seems clean and is quiet and comfortable. The price is usually a good value. I recommend it. For those of you who need a place to park your car while out of town, they have some kind of special deal for that.

ReviewText:The room telephone didn't work. We were changed to another room where the phone didn't work either. At that point we didn't ask for another room because we had little time left and we didn't want the hassle of another room change.

ReviewText:I've stayed at the Hacienda before. Although not the best looking hotel, it's a great location for an overnight stay close to the airport and easy enough even if you rent a car and tour LA. Breakfast at the Mariposa is also very good and great value for money. Finally, unlike luxury hotels where the feather pillows are way too soft and suffocating, this hotel uses firm pillows that support your head and neck, love it!! Would definitely stay there again.
