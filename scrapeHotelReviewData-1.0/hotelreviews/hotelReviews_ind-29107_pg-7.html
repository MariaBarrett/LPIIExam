ReviewText:This was my third trip to California due to a family emergency and my stay was wonderful. This is a great location for tourists. There is so much to do and see in this area plus the metro is a block away. One metro stop away from Universal. The only bad thing  is that there was not a mini regierator in my room. Not sure if you needed to request it. But other than that the hotel is beautiful, huge and connected to the highland mall. Really , really nice.

ReviewText:My first time traveling to LA to see Hollywood and take a little time off for leisure.  This hotel is about 5 minutes drive to Universal Studios, right next to Hollywood Blvd, and really close the Melrose, Sunset, and Santa Monica blvd.  Excellent location for travelers going to Hollywood.

ReviewText:The Hotel is adjacent to The Highland Center without the overflow crowd, it's around the corner from The Walk of Fame, Chinese Theater, the Metro, and it sits on top of a clean municiple parking facility. Can't beat that.

ReviewText:Great location for the Hollywood Bowl.  Room was clean, but not luxurious.  The TV was afflicted by "fat faces"... like many cheap hotels... but you don't come to a hotel like this to watch TV.

ReviewText:I stayed in Hollywood as a typical tourist and the location of the hotel was more than perfect. Accessible to everything including the metro which allowed me to go to Santa Monica pier, Griffith Park and downtown LA. -newline- Wish there was a mini fridge to hold snacks.

ReviewText:What I most enjoyed was the spectacular view outside our window, showing was the hollywood sign and the hollywood hills. Missing was, the lack of control of ruely behavior outside of our hotel room. Overall, the stay was really enjoyable and the location was perfect for the various activities we were in.
