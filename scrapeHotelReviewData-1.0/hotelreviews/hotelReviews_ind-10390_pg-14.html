ReviewText:Durring my stay at the Biltmore, everthing was to our satisfaction. The rooms were always clean, there is a very nice bar by the lobby, a pool with a steam room and hot tub, and the staff was very helpful. Although above all, it has great location. You can navigate the subway easily, there are two stations by the hotel to get to wherever you want to go. Overall, great hotel and a great experience

ReviewText:My mother stayed here over the weekend and very much enjoyed her stay. She has some pretty high standards too! She thought it was pretty and charming, and found the staff to be very helpful. Indoor pool was great for her stay, as LA was in the middle of heatwave that weekend. She also enjoyed the tea room and restaurant.

ReviewText:The Biltmore is classy and beautiful, but the rooms are old. Our room was a bit musty and the furnishings and trim were a bit dated.

ReviewText:Let me start with the good. The Biltmore is a good, no, Great old hotel in terms of decor. The ceilings alone are worth a trip to see this grand old dame of Los Angeles. The mojitos in the bar were great. And my interactions with the staff were good as well. But... -newline- ...$9.95 for WiFi? Lots of places include it free or if they do charge you like Motel 6 it three bucks. Forty dollars for parking? Really? And then there's the renovation- apparently it's still going on because there was a paint cart in the hallway when we arrived. And much of what they've done is paint and no more, as in painting the old bathtub. Leave the old porcelain as is. That type of paint invariably peels and it looks worse than if you'd left it. It's like plastic surgery, you look younger, but never young. Let the patina of this gem shine. -newline- Would I stay again? Maybe.

ReviewText:Experience was good. I had not been to this hotel in about 15 years - when it had been completely renovated. Was disappointed to see the carpeting in the hallways duct taped together and worn/dirty. Had the carpeting been in good shape the hotel would have been perfect.

ReviewText:Grand lobby and historic area.  Bathrooms are old and windows are not sound proof to city traffic early in morning.  However, magnificient lobby and easy access offset some of the historic shortcomings.  Enjoyed the casual bar next to lobby as great place to meet and socialize.  For the price and high level of service, it is a good value.

ReviewText:The venues & restuarants I visited were within walking distance. And, the weather was fit for a walkabout each day. Darn... i missed out on their exercise room. But i was just too tired each day. The hotel bed was very comfortable.. not too plush & not too hard. The front desk staff were informative and very helpful; basically they were outstanding. I'd definitely stay here again.

ReviewText:The hotel was very elegant but the rooms were small. The resturaunts and room service was expediant but the food was not good or worth the cost. I called the hotel two days in advance to make sure of an early check in, smoking room and late check out. However, when I arrived my room was not ready and I had to wait an additional hour for a smoking room.  The staff was friendly and polite.
