ReviewText:We found this hotel to be very good in general. However, we were disappointed with the response for the maintenance issues. The bathrom shower water was consistently luke warm. Reuested the hotel staff to address this issue but till the last day this issue was not fixed and hotel did not suggest any alternate options. A good hotel would go an entra mile to make sure that the customer is satisfied, but in this case it appear to fall on deaf ears.

ReviewText:My wife and I stayed over night at this hotel to celebrate 10 years of marriage. The hotel room was great with a amazing view. It is walking distance to the Univaersal city walk. The room service food was suprisingly good, and the matinee show of WICKED topped off a great weekend.

ReviewText:I chose this hotel for my senior citizen parents who wanted to attend the Hollywood Bowl, but did not want to drive home afterwards so late at night.      The hotel was easy to get to, a little intimidating for them because it was so big, but the front desk staff was very accommodating and one clerk even took the time to escort my parents to the elevators and explain the key for elevator access.  My folks were staying on a concierge floor, but they didn't need any concierge service.  However, they had access to the continental breakfast the next day, which was wonderful (I didn't stay with them, but the concierge invited me to have breakfast with them).  I would recommend this hote for its service.

ReviewText:I have stayed at the hotel before in rooms that are more updated.   The rooms had flat screen tvs.   Our room had an old tv in the old style entertainment center, and the sound on the tv was distorted some of the time.   That was a little disappointing but the overall stay was nice.   Next time I will ask for an upgraded room.   The location in Burbank is great.

ReviewText:i love this hilton.   the people are nice, the pool is amazing, and the food is incredible.      the beds are really soft and comfy.   the room service is amazing.      the room wasn't as nice as my first stay -- with a bigger room with a couch and a huge desk, but it was adequate.      it's so easy to get on the 101 or the 5 and id close to the Burbank airport.      go hilton!
