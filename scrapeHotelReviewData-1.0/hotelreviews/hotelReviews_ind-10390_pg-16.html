ReviewText:This hotel was gorgeous. The rooms were about average, but the lobby and other areas felt like a grand hotel in the movies.

ReviewText:We just love the Biltmore. We arrived very tired and the receptionist was wonderful and put us in a room that was quite. We were very grateful. This is  a beautiful old hotel with at lot of history to it. The location is downtown but very close to Pershing Square Metro where we caught the subway to Hollywood. Very convenient.. Just love this hotel.

ReviewText:We've stayed at the Millennium several times and always enjoy the stay.  The last couple of times we have requested a room with a view and both times our request has been met with pleasure.  This visit, there was even a call to the room to make sure that we were satisfied.  Lovely.  There are many great restaurants within walking distance.  And, the bar is classic and comfortable...a welcome reward after a long day.  The historic hotel is a gem.

ReviewText:The decorative architecture of this hotel is magnificent. The rooms are large and the mattresses very comfortable. The staff is very friendly and competent. The Smirelda  Restaurant's food is fair.

ReviewText:Magnificent (some of the best I've seen) public spaces. Reeks of the elegance of another era. Gracious, friendly service. Room elegant, a little rough around the edges. Comfortable bed, nice pillows. Then there are the guests (does anyone dress in LA anymore?). I was offered a "quiet" or "noisy" (view but with traffic noise) room. Chose the "quiet" option which would have been the case except for the apparent legions of drunken, high decibel, revelers pounding up the hallways until after 3 AM. Perhaps Saturday nights do not show the Biltmore to best advantage. The bar is well worth the sobering cost of the booze although how anyone can get truly lit at those prices is beyond me. In sum,if you really don't mind sleepless bags under your eyes the Biltmore is worth every penny.

ReviewText:This once elegant hotel sorely needs some attention. -newline- The rooms were poorly appointed, the windows dirty, the -newline- cupboards missing hardware. It's sad to see the grand -newline- dame of downtown Los Angeles so tawdry and unkempt.

ReviewText:We were in LA for NBA All Star Weekend.  All the basketball legends were staying at the Millenium Biltmore Hotel which made our hotel experience amazing.  The hotel was gorgeous, the service was amazing, and the parking attendants were on the ball.  The only thing I would recommend is upgrading the TV's in the guest room.

ReviewText:Thank goodness I got a packaged deal. I would have been disappointed otherwise. -newline-  -newline- 1) USD40 a day parking (or USD35 for self park across the street... not good for late night returns) that I didn't recall was included in the description -newline- 2) Valet service with a "minimum wage attitude" (they likely are paid min wage though) -newline- 3) Lackluster room... Tube TV (I've gotten cheaper rates in beverly hills with flatscreens), dated furniture with simple no frills bed, simple bathroom with plastic wrapped HoJo cups (yes, NO GLASS cups or mugs for the coffee maker). -newline- 4) Internet fee of 9.95$ per day
