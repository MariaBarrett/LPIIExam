ReviewText:Wonderfully restored California lnadmark. Large comfortable room with great bed. But $40.00 for the privilege of parking your car is more than a bit onerous. The Valets were very efficient and courteous, and for that price they surely should be.

ReviewText:We had a great time at the bar and a wonderful breakfast the next day. We were only there less than 24 hours, but a great weekend get away. Parking fee is $40.00 per day with unlimited in & out.

ReviewText:The ground floors of this hotel are a jewel or architecture.  I parked my car at a public lot across the street for only $10.  Why stay in a modern, non-descript hotel for $85 when you can enjoy looking at places used in hundreds of movies and TV shows ?

ReviewText:My son and I visited here this past June 2009 and it was a delightful experience.  We didn't have a car but the subway was right across the street so we were able to go back and forth on it to our destinations.  The only complaint that I have is that the windows in the rooms aren't double pane and so there was a rather noisy generator going all night outside the room.  Other than that the hotel is breathtaking.  The staff members, for the most part, are very friendly and helpful.  There was maybe one that was a bit snooty when we checked in.  Also, the beds sleep like a dream!  Very comfortable.

ReviewText:Gorgeous elegant classic hotel but without the "tired feeling".  The lobby, bar, hallway, restaurant and bar were all very elegant.  While I was there, film crews were filming scenes for the TV show Castle.  The setting seemed perfect. -newline-  -newline- The rooms were elegant but a little bit outdated with small TVs in cabinets. -newline-  -newline- I chose this hotel instead of a "preferred" hotel for a recent convention that I attended and was glad I made the choice.  It was nicer and also significantly less expensive.

ReviewText:Our trip was for a "Bible Crusade" in downtown LA and was 1/2 mile from hotel and the courtesy limo took us over and picked us up twice a day with no wait. We had many meal choices in the local area. The only thing we missed was no place to eat in hotel at 5pm. Everything opens at 6PM. -newline- We wanted a refrigerator for the room and they brought one up quickly and a light out that was repair immediately as well. Staff was great to us and we would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in LA.We travel a lot and this was a pleasant stay.
