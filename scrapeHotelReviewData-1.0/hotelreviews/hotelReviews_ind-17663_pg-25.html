ReviewText:Averall hotel is good. -newline- Biggest problem of this hotel is a parking saces. You came evening late - no parking and you put your car somehere on empty place, blocking other cars. -newline- Second problem - cleaning. I was staying for a week and expect room to be as i'm first day at the hotel. -newline- But it's not like that. Not adding cofe, sugar, towels and etc. -newline- Other then that - hotel is good, stuff is friendly.

ReviewText:Very dirty elevators. Rooms OK but not worth $180+ per night. Not even worth the 50% discount rate per night. -newline- No receipt offered for stay at hotel even though requested. -newline- I would not rush back here in a hurry.

ReviewText:We booked the room and asked for a handicapped room. When we checked in the only handicapped parking was in front of the office and our room was around the other side of another building and there were speed bumps and dips. We asked the staff for help and they told us we could park in a no parking spot closer to the room, but the speed bumps were there and the slope of the street made us almost flip the wheelchair and left me screaming and crying. The air conditioning in the room started off cold but I woke up sweating as it broke during the night. In the morning I called the office and they said they would send someone, but the time kept changing and I had my doctor's appt. by then. If you are ok then the room will be fine for you, but if you're handicapped or hurt I would look elsewhere.

ReviewText:Manager accused us of pushing staff and being rude. In fact staff was rude and obnoxious when we complained that the room was not ready when we went to room after being told it was and the clerk at the front desk checked us in and gave us the key. Then the manager essentially asked us to leave if we were unhappy. It was too much trouble to leave for a quick one night stay but never again.

ReviewText:My family was there for a wedding. I would say the hotel was just average. There was a workout room, easy access to the highway and free USA Today papers. Denny's restaurant right next door made breakfast easy.

ReviewText:I would give this hotel an average grade. We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds and room was small. The toilet was clogged the same day, when we asked for a maintenance it turned out that the housekeeping accidentally threw a soap in the toilet and it was clogged. Cleaning services did not change our towels daily, we had to ask them for clean towels, also no shampoo refills. TV was not working so we had to ask maintenance to fix it. Overall this hotel is ok, but for the price we payed we could find a better place in a better neighborhood. We really enjoyed their hot tub!
