ReviewText:Many niced things like common areas to spend time with our family, but pool closes at dusk and was not very clean. Rooms also not overly clean, but acceptable. No coffee, fridge or microwave in room. No a/c in the building! Nothing free in the morning (breakfast, coffee) Coffee cost $4 at the restaurant on site. If I am looking there again, I will look specifically for those missing amenities we expect to be there and consider what they are worth. Did shuttle us to and from LAX without any trouble

ReviewText:Checked in and got to my room. it was nice and easy to find. good places around the area as well as room service from the restaurant downstairs by the lobby. Gas stations nearby, IHOP, Starbucks, Chase, Five Guys,Rubios, and a Ralphs all right across the street. Staff was helpful.

ReviewText:Poor experience all round. One of the 2 elevators was taken "out of service" for a "major upgrade" (leaving 1 slow elevator covering 9 floors, UGLY!), the air-conditioning did not work (a call to maintenance said "it's heat only", despite our room being in the high 80s, and the hallway in the 60s... something's fishy). Our first room was not what we'd booked (small bed, and smelt of stale cigarette smoke). H/T to Cameron for sorting out that part, so at least we got the right bed - had we not, the wife and I would have been sleeping in separate areas of the room due to the oppressive heat in the 8th floor of the South Tower. Had to open the door to the outside, and deal with the noise of the highway to somewhat mitigate the heat, the rusty safety railing made me stay well away from looking out though! -newline-  -newline- Needless to say, not what we wanted after a red-eye flight from Fiji and a full day's air travel the next day. Avoid if you value your sanity. Our previous stay at La Quinta was much better for around the same spend (oh, and got free breakfast there too, not here!)

ReviewText:The hotel shuttle bus is available from LAX airport. -newline- There are many places such as restaurants, cafes, and supermarket near the hotel. I love the diner in the hotel. The humbeger is huge and delicious! The room is large enough but a little bit dark for me.

ReviewText:Good hotel for what we needed- a night stay after coming off a late night flight. The hotel is just a bit old- for example, our tap in the bathroom sink had come away from sink but the staff were great and said they would fix it ASAP. But if you need just a night or more to make your travel to and from the airport easier its great. Plus free shuttle bus to and from the airport there are also lots of places to eat close by.

ReviewText:The Pro's -newline- -Only 5 minutes from the terminal -newline- -Free Shuttle -newline-  -newline- The Con's -newline- -Annex building is not up to bar with the rest of the facility -newline- -Staff originally issued me keys to a room that was already in use. -newline-  -newline- Other Thoughts -newline- -at night they only have 1 check in agent. I had to wait half an hour just to be checked in. -newline- -wifi is provided free, but the access key is not provided in their pamphlet, you must contact the front desk to get it. -newline-  -newline- Bottom line: For the price, I expect a great deal more out of a hotel than to be placed in a rickety annex building with elevators that give the impression that they will be giving out at any moment.
