ReviewText:Got a room with a view in the 13th floor, it was pretty good. The first floor was noisy with late night parties in the ballroom, not my problem but I would not stay in the first 5 floors

ReviewText:We shopped downtown.  I felt completely safe. I arrived before check in time and the staff let us check in early because I have a special needs son.  I greatly appreciated this help.

ReviewText:We had a very pleasant stay, with no complaints other than it taking quite a long time to check out.  The restaurant in particular has a very nice breakfast menu, with an outstanding wait-staff. -newline-  -newline- Like most hotels, the room lighting was a little dim for reading.

ReviewText:Easy to find, free garage parking, friendly staff, large room, nice pool. In LA area for a travel break from a flight from Boston to Australia. Went to Dodger Stadium for a baseball game first night, met up with friends for dinner before leaving for Australia. No hassle parking in the garage, just need a validated ticket when leaving each time, not a problem. -newline- Pool area was small but only a few people using it. Bring sandals because the bricks get too hot when sun is out.

ReviewText:My son and I were finding a place for him to live in the Los Angeles area. The hotel was an excellent place to relax and to get to all the area "tourist traps". Burbank is a lovely city.

ReviewText:I got a room what you call the type of room. -newline- There was a door between rooms. I don't like any noise. Few night, those night I couldn't sleep until morning. So If They have regular room(don't have door!!)you need to ask what kind of room for you!!
