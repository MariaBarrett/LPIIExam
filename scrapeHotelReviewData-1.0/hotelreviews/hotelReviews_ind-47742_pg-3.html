ReviewText:I stayed once at this hotel and was completely satisfied, so booked again. Im meeting my son there. He comes in at 6am, myself 6 pm. When I called the hotel to ask a few questions including could he check in earlier, the response was "I can not help you, you booked through a 3rd party". Even when I asked how full the hotel was, I got the same response and I must say, NOT in a nice tone. Omni, get someone to take your calls. This rep will scare people away.

ReviewText:Wonderful weekend stay. Great service from every single person we encountered. Very comfy bed and sheets, very clean, very private. Just wish parking wasn't so expensive... I hope my car had just as great a stay. Was tough to get into the valet parking circle around 10 pm on a Friday night, but once they saw we were a guest, they let us leave it in the back of the pack and took care of it from there.
