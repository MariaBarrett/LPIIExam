ReviewText:Beautiful historical landmark right in the heart of downtown in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Easy access to the subway, historical districts and downtown. Stayed here for our honeymoon and it was very romantic. -newline-  -newline- The room had a comically old TV with mediocre reception, but who goes on vacation to watch TV?  Woke up with a sore lower back every morning, but beds tend to wreak havoc on my back unless they're just right.

ReviewText:Very nice old hotel. Rooms had been updated. Small bathroom though. VERY noisy! It is downtown so lots of street noise through the windows. If you are a heavy sleeper, it won't bother you. Great location to Dodger Stadium! Parking is expensive (right around 40/night), but there are a few overnight parking garages around that are cheaper!

ReviewText:The hotel is elegant to the extent of its history but that's about it.  It's in a dire need of a renovation.

ReviewText:Amazing time. Staff very friendly and helpful!! Were going to check in early but they told us if we waited a couple hours, we would get an amazing corner room. Best decision we ever made!!

ReviewText:The rooms are huge but there was not much furniture in ours. Not really a problem, but it would have been nice to have a dresser or an extra chair since there's all that space. -newline-  -newline- The pool is warm and super-ornate. Beautiful, really. There's a sauna and a hot tub, and the whole thing is surrounded by the fitness center, separated by glass. -newline-  -newline- The only issue is that you'll have to walk through the lobby (and then down a series of hallways) to get to the pool. If there's a convention, prepare for lots of people to see you in swim wear! -newline-  -newline- Check in/out was seamless, and while the parking was expensive, the valet crew couldn't have been more efficient and nice. Plan an extra $40/night for parking.

ReviewText:This is a beautiful hotel, no doubt.  Of particular interest are the historic photographs and the gorgeous architecture.  Having a bathroom sink that would not drain is a disgusting inconvenience.  And finding out when you drive into the valet parking area that you will be paying $40 for one night's parking is not a pleasant surprise.

ReviewText:The hotel is a deco palace, but getting into a room took an hour.  First, they had entered our reservation for the wrong date, and it took them 20 minutes and a manager to correct it.  Next, we went up to our room, only to find someone else already in the room!  The front desk took another 15 minutes to send someone up with keys to another room.  Really, a comedy of errors, but not very funny.

ReviewText:historical hotel in the heart of LA.  The staff was friendly and when asked for an upper level room upgraded us.  Lots of charactor and history into the hotel.  Needs some work in the hall ways upstairs as it is getting old.  Easy access to hw 101 and all places in LA.  Parking is 40$ but you can park in the near by parkings for 15$ over night and 6.50$ for the weekend day time.  Olive st and 4th through 1st are a little unsafe at nights so need to be with someone if walking alone there.  Overall would come back there again.
