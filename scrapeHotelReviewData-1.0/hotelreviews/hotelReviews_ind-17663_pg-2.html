ReviewText:The big negative to our time here was the remodel, and I can't really blame anyone for that. A hotel has a right to remodel! So it's too bad that our window overlooked the dumpster. There was only noise during one day, and never at night. We had to use different stairs. Neighborhood borderlines scary when you go north or east, but I did feel the hotel was a nice one, and convenient to be close to 405 and the galleria. The pool was nice and staff was friendly and helpful. Just be sure to check if they're done with the remodel if that kind of thing would bother you. Otherwise, I do recommend this location.

ReviewText:WE WERE ONLY IN L.A. FOR A FEW DAYS TO VISIT AN AILING RELATIVE. AT FIRST GLANCE THE BEST WESTERN CARRIAGE INN WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND THE ROOM WAS VERY CLEAN. -newline- PROBLEM WAS.....THE SECOND DAY THE HOT WATER WAS ALMOST NON EXISTENT..I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING BUT WE WERE IN A HURRY...THE THIRD DAY (WE WERE CATCHING AN 8:00 A.M PLANE)..THERE WAS NO HOT WATER AT ALL..THE NIGHT BEFORE MY HUSBAND WENT TO GET SOME BOTTLE WATER AND THERE WAS NONE...NOT IN THE MACHINE..NOT ANYWHERE.. -newline- ASIDE FROM THAT..THE LOCATION FOR US WAS PRETTY GOOD. WE WERE VERY CLOSE TO BUS LINES WHICH ENABLED US TO GET WHERE WE WANTED TO GO.....THE TRAFFIC WAS NOT TERRIBLY NOISY BUT THE PARKING LOT WAS..LOTS OF TRUCK SOUNDS AND IT STARTED VERY EARLY.....LIKE 6 A.M....AND THROUGH THE NIGHT AS WELL...

ReviewText:The hotel is clean & neat looking - the room had 2 queen sized beds that were very comfortable. The pool is not extra large but we enjoyed it, For us the area was perfect - near relatives and friends that we wanted to see & not too far from LA, Hollywood, & the airport. The staff in the office were very helpful and pleasant. We definitely would stay here again.

ReviewText:Third floor of one bldg had one part leaking. The first room they gave us was leaking was well. They gave us a new room immediately which is good. Room was clean, there was a divider between the beds and the wash are before the bathroom, which gave a little privacy when with company. Location is okay, area seemed safe and a few minutes away from downtown LA and Hollywood. However there wasnt much in the neighborhood, only a Denny's by the hotel. No comp breakfast, which makes it a little expensive. They let us checkin earlier than 3pm which is the best thing.

ReviewText:The location was perfect for our visit. Denny's was next door which made breakfast very convenient. Staff was very friendly. Only downside was there are no microwaves in the room. We had leftovers from dinner but no way to heat them.

ReviewText:We had a great week. We were visiting relatives, and the hotel was less than 2 miles from them. The hotel was very clean, the pool area was nice too. The only problem we had was the construction that was going on during the week. It was hard to find a parking spot close to our room because of all the construction vehicles. All in all, it was a very nice vacation.

ReviewText:Everything great here, we stayed 3 days. I was worried about the proximity to the freeway being a problem but it wasn't. They made every effort to please. -newline- The parking was a little tight though. -newline- Great experience overall.
