ReviewText:I came to LA for a meeting down the street from the hotel. Everything was perfect. The food was fabulous and brought to my room quickly. The TV was even easy to use.

ReviewText:We stayed at this Hotel for 3 nights. The room and the bathroom were very comfortable and luxurious too. The balcony faced the pool and direct sunrise everyday, which was a delight to watch. -newline- The only con was that there was no coffee maker, you had to request for it. -newline- Recommendation is- if you want to experience luxury, then it's a thumbs up.

ReviewText:Perfect hotel location if you're going business in Hollywood area. Would stay again. -newline- Only comment is the restaurants are very expensive. Fruit, oatmeal and coffee in the morning was $52 delivered to my room. Seems a tad too much.

ReviewText:The hotel was aesthetically appealing. Customer service was generally good. Room was nice and comfortable. Live band at the hotel bar at night was really fun. Hotel location is ideal, right across the street from a very appealing outdoor mall and movie theater off of Sunset Strip. Outdoor swinging hammocks and multiple pools and hot tubs were an additional treat. Complimentary fresh flowers for my room put a big smile on my face.

ReviewText:Good location for getting around LA. Disappointed that gym access was an extra $20. Nice pool area. Valet was always quick to bring around the car.

ReviewText:We loved the hotel room, the facility and some of the staff. We wanted to get Lakers tickets and it seemed that the concierge just made one brief call and when he could not find tickets just gave up instead of coming up with other useful leads or tips.
