ReviewText:This hotel was aoutstanding!  From the check-inn representative at the front desk to the valet parkers and the bellman, staff members went beyond the call to make our stay efficient and enjoyable.  The adjoining rooms for us and our children and grandchildren was a perfect set-up, with double doors opening on to a vestabule.  The kids could move easily between rooms without going out in the hall or disturbing other guests.  The hotel was spacious and felt like a 5 star accomodation - at a very good rate.  Valet parking at $33 per night was expensive.

ReviewText:Our room was very comfortable, except the heat did not work during a very cod snap in December. The hotel offered to move us but we were really really happy with the incredible view off the City and Pacific Ocean from our balcony room on the Penthouse Level....so we just asked for more blankets. The parking is steep at $33. per day. Room amenities and service are top notch. There is a new movie theatre with 3D and IMAX right across the street. Excellent location. Everything is there except a coin laundry.

ReviewText:Excellent hotel, clean, quiet.      Only complaints are:   1- Hotel does not have free parking   2- There is no hair dryer in the room         Other than these two minor items, it is an   excellent hotel for the value.

ReviewText:Hyatt Regency Century Plaza hotel has a many good points for a view of Business.      Room was fairly enough big and clean and comfortable. Location is very quite and good for a business meeting and in and out to down town even easy excess to highway and all fashion districts like Rodeo,Hollywood etc.      Just leave it to Hyatt name and you wou't be dispointed.      Another point, Westfield Shopping mall is 5 minutes walking distance. You can see all brand name retailers and nice quality of merchaideses.

ReviewText:I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza hotel for work when I've had a press junket I was holding and had a fantastic stay during that time. The service was incredible for my accommodations as well as my event.      Then more recently, I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza Hotel for leisure (coming back to LA to visit friends) and it was just truly an excellent experience! The service was fantastic from the moment we checked in and it was just truly great the entire time. On Halloween night (our first night stay there), we came back to the hotel late and wanted a snack and although technically the kitchen was closed, they still made us the snack! Very nice treat for us that night!      I would absolutely recommend the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza hotel for those looking to stay in a classy, top-level hotel in the center of it all in Los Angeles.

ReviewText:This hotel was a great hotel in every way.  Not only was it clean, had helpful staff, full of amenities, and good bang for the buck, but it was also perfectly located in the middle of all the bustle of Hollywood and the relaxation of the beaches.  If you're looking to go sightseeing all over LA, this is the location to be at.  This is where I will stay, next time in LA.

ReviewText:The Hyatt was everything that I thought it would be, only better. From the minute I pulled in the valet to the minute I checked out, the service was top notch. The staff was friendly and helpful and the room was excellent. The location of the hotel was perfect as I was in town for a wedding. It was central to the beach as well as the Hollywood hills. I am thrilled with my stay at the Hyatt and will certainly stay there again if I am back in Los Angeles.
