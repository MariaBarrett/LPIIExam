ReviewText:Stayed here previously and was very impressed with everything.... Second time not so much... Staff wasn't very friendly and we were put in a bad room and to be honest, for the price it was a bit small.... Go for the king room always... IF you can get a deal on the price.

ReviewText:This place was a little pricey but its the convenience factor. The Towers building has the nicest rooms and I recommend that as a request. Room was modern and comfy. Woman was hosing off the driveway during the morning when people are checking out which was awkward because it was full of people stepping over the hose.

ReviewText:It was a fine hotel. A little on the noisy side. I stopped by at 9am to leave my car and asked for a quiet room when I checked in later. I went back at about 6pm and when I got my room it wasn't that quiet. When I called down to the front desk I was told those rooms got taken first. I explained that I had stopped by at 9am to arrange for a quiet room. He asked the name of the person I spoke to which I gave him, but still there were no other rooms. It was clean enough and efficient.

ReviewText:My friends and I stayed here over MLK Weekend, and we didn't have any problems at all. Over the course of the weekend I spoke to three different staff members, and they were all incredibly curteous, friendly and helpful. We were even given the choice of what level we would like our room to be on. The room was updated and modern and very clean. The only downside was no continental breakfast, but I usually like to try breakfast places in the area anyway so that wasn't a huge downer. I would definitely stay here again!
