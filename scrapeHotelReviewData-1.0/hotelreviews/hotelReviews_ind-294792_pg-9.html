ReviewText:Sweet. Valet was slow but understandable because it was Grammy weekend.

ReviewText:My boyfriend and I statyed in this hotel two nights while we enjoyed exploring the city and Hollywood.  The location was great but for the price we paid I wasn't impressed with the room at all.  Our room was very small, only had a bed that laid directly on the floor, and the shower was completely glass and in the middle of the room.  Therefore, none of your bathroomly duties were private.  We didn't have a coffee maker or cups, or really anything extra.  Everything extra was an extra charge to your account.  The hotel roof was amazing though.  It had a pool and bar but we both still felt out of place.  If your not made of money or use to being pampered on, then this is not the place for you.  We never left our room unless we were leaving the hotel.  It doesn't have that friendly inviting vibe to just wonder around and do as you please.

ReviewText:Always a great place to celebrate in the heart of downtown with fellow partygoers rather than families and business people.  Hotel staff is decent, but this time, it was better as they were friendly (most of the time they're not).

ReviewText:My coworkers and I stayed while attending an event at the Convention Center.  I arrived around 9am and I was welcomed but two very friendly staff members and I was able to check in to my room straight away.  Very hip and trendy indeed and almost retro.  After the event and long day we spent the evening at one of the coolest spots in Downtown, on the ROOF!  The lounge was amazing with the mixed atomosphere, fireplace and water beds next to the pool!  We had an amazing time and for a reasonable price.  I will recommend the Standard Downtown LA to all of my friends.  Rooms were great, beds were incredibly comfortable and the bubble bath in the oversized tub similar to the size of a single bed, next to the window was quite memorable.  The Mini Bar and supplies were fun to check out too!  Thank you for a fabulous weekend.

ReviewText:I have known of The Standard for quite some time having lived across the street from it for 5 years.  The hotel's attraction is its edge, atmosphere, unusual rooms and rooftop pool/bar which is used for filming in many TV commercials these days.  One of these attractions is usually enough to make the experience worthwhile and it was this time. -newline-  -newline- The hotel's negatives are lackadaisical and sometimes aloof staff (front desk these time), the slow bell/valet service/front desk at peak times, and noise in the hallways as post-bar disrespectful people go to their rooms and sometimes decide to hang out in the hall and post-party as they did during this stay.  At checkout time the bell person never appeared to my room after 40 minutes (and 1 reminder call) so I carted my stuff downstairs to the check out desk.  The line was prohibitively long with only two desk staff working at a peak time, so I had to bypass check out and call their accounting office two days later in order to get my bill faxed to me. (The first time I called, the person in accounting never called back so I called a second time the next day and got someone live). -newline-  -newline- Valet car retrieval was slow. It took about 20 minutes with only 3 other people in line in front of me. -newline-  -newline- This is the good and the bad with The Standard that I've known for quite a while. Perhaps some things just won't change there.

ReviewText:I came to LA,California to treat my father to four baseball games to see the LA Dodgers play at Dodger Stadium.  As soon as I walked in the Standard Hotel Room, I immediately felt uncomfortable because the shower, (which seemed to be the focal point of the room) was surrounded by glass and it had no curtain for privacy. One of us had to leave the room when the other one had to shower, which was ridiculous.  The Hotel was gloomy and dark. This atmosphere is perfect for the younger crowd (college bound or young newlyweds).  A plus was that the rooms were clean and the employees were friendly.

ReviewText:Overall, it was a pretty good hotel, great location and friendly staff. The only thing I feel unsatisfied is that the person who clean our rooms did not give us brand new lotion, conditioner, soap etc. every night. I don't know if it is an individual problem or the hotel's policy. Personally, I prefer more than less, or just enough.

ReviewText:Had guest only access to the pool, a cool atmosphere, awesome valet service.  Called for a towel late at night (noticed the cleaning staff didn't put out two) and it was brought up with no problem or delay!  Would recommend strongly.  I did not dine here and so rated it neutral.

ReviewText:Even though it's a hip hotel, the staff are not full of themselves.  Stayed four nights, in town for a wedding.  We had five rooms and lots of service requests - concierge, housekeeping, pool bar, etc.  Everyone was just fantastic - [...] the rooftop bar/pool manager, [...] at the front desk, the long-haired surfer dude at the valet station.
