ReviewText:This hotel is right in the heart of Hollywood. Easy to get to Burbank, Beverly Hills, etc. Some type of entertainment going on all the time by the locals. You couldn't ask for a better location. This was our 2nd time to stay there. Little disappointed in room decorating than the last time. Before all the rooms were so colorful , now it has tan walls and looks like a typical hotel room. Staff is wonderful. Room was kept very clean. If ever back around LA, this is the place we would stay at again.

ReviewText:The hotel location is great for tourists, central to a large number of sites like the Kodak Theater and such and it is clean and well maintained with a beautiful pool area and great views of the Hollywood sign and Los Angeles downtown. That being said, they nickel and dime you in a ridiculous way. There is a $13 charge for wifi connection and a $5 charge to print at the business center. The Holiday Inn Express a half block away has both of these for free, charges half the price and has free parking. At a luxury hotel, charge me for the room, don't add extra dollars for services that should be a given in 2011!

ReviewText:This hotel is ideally situated for exploring Hollywood. The hotel is well appointed and the staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful in assisting with planning day trips. The room was comfortable and the bed heavenly! Our only complaint was with one aspect of housekeeping. We were there for 5 days. The bathroom, while restocked each day with fresh towels,etc. was not vacuumed and tub not cleaned even after we brought this to the attention of Management.

ReviewText:Very nice hotel really close to Kodak Theatre and Hollywood Walk of Fame.  Also nice shops and restaurants on the same block.  Easy to catch a bus from there to  other areas.  Only complaint about the room there was  no alarm clock/radio.

ReviewText:This is a nice hotel, pretty much average rooms but well kept. It has a younger group of people as guests, 20's to early 40's I would say. The lobby can be a bit noisy during daytime hours but not too bad. The room service fast and the food quite good with a small free desert. The only problem I had, the maid service was slow. Came back after four hours out and the room still not done. I did call housekeepng and they did send a maid after 45 minutes. The location is right off Hollywood Blvd. The street is full of tourists and always busy . Just like the Vegas strip. I did not find any nice restaurants in the area. Hollywood still has that honkey tonk atmosphere.

ReviewText:Nice hotel in a very busy area of Hollywood. Street and foot traffic 24/7 just outside the door. Young guests and like to party, hey it is Hollywood. If you like quiet stay in Beverly Hills. I was here doing work for a TV studio and it does not bother me.

ReviewText:Everything was great, the only downfall was my upgrade. I went from a standard room to a city view. The only thing was that I was looking at roof tops. Other than that, it was great.

ReviewText:The good first. The location is central to everything LA. The property is located in the heart of Hollywood and the two blocks of tourist friendly vendors that it has to offer. The rooms are large and some have an excellent view. The neighborhood is very rough at night and not for the faint at heart and certainly not for young children. I would NOT consider this to be a family friendly location. Just a metro train station away, or a short drive (10 min) are the Universal Hilton and Sheraton, these properties are much more children friendly.Now for my humble opinion on the service level that guests will receive for their traveling dollars. I travel an average of 50 nights a year, and have stayed at this property a number of times. Each time I have stayed here I have encounter, lazy, unhappy and useless employees. I have been enticed back on several occassions by promisses of a perfect experience and a new attitude. However, each time I receive increasingly bad customer service and a management team that should be running a resort in Syberia. Resident Manager [...] is absolutely to blame or the poor quality of service at this property. Coupled with his partner [...], this dynamic-duo of poor customer service dish-up absolutely the worst experience that this frequent traveler has ever received. I will always give a place a second, and in this case a number more chances, however, this time my duty is to you the consumer. I encourage you to avoid the Renaissancâ€‹e Hollywood Hotel & Spa at all cost. If you want to stay in this area, stay at one of the properties previously mentioned, or maybe the historical Roosevelt Hotel directly south of this horrible hotel.
