ReviewText:we used the spa for a reflexology (Chris) and pedicure (cant remember her name but she was originally from San Diego) and I cant rave enough about them.  They were so lovely and helpful. If you could please pass this onto to them?

ReviewText:Had a great time. Nice room, great location, comfy bed. It's located right in the middle of all the sight seeing activities that you would need on a Hollywood vacation! The metro is convenient as transportation to Universal Studios $1.25 each way. Can't beat that. I was surprised that the hotel charged a $1.35 for each local call that is >5 miles away.I sure didn't see anything posted informing me of that one. I would of used my cell phone for free if I knew that. We also had charges from our mini bar that we did not use. (They removed those charges without asking twice) Nice hotel. We had a blast!

ReviewText:I've stayed in this hotel five times or so, this is the first time with kids. They loved the pool, and the location is superb. We walked to see the movie at El Capitan Theater, had dinner in the Disney Soda Fountain room, and walked around looking at all the stars on the sidewalks. Parents should be prepared that this isn't the most wholesome neighborhood - women in scanty costumes, lots of stores selling black leather biker and SM garb, sexy lingerie, bongs, etc. But it's a kick for an afternoon, with the Wax Museum and Ripley's Museum also within walking distance.

ReviewText:The moment I arrived at the hotel the staff were very pleasant. I was confused about the parking structure and the hotel staff answered all my questions professionally and friendly. Plus once I checked in they were very formal with saying my last name and made you feel special.

ReviewText:I was in L.A. for an art show.  Because I've been to L.A. previously, I knew the location was going to be just what I needed, I just didn't know if the hotel would meet my expectations.  The hotel was great, I loved the decor of the lobby and the rooms and I loved the down comforters and pillows. I can honestly say I was very comfortable and felt like I was at home. I looked forward to going back to the hotel to rest and relax after being out all day.  I was also extremely pleased to find Aveda products in the bath room, especially the moisturizer!

ReviewText:Expensive but not extremely so considering the area. Staff was friendly. Room was fine. They charged $14 per day for Internet. It was nice that the hotel is very close to the subway stop on Hollywood Blvd so you don't need a car. Decent food is also within walking distance and there is a grocer close by on Hollywood Blvd so you can buy healthy fruits & veggies if you don't want to eat restaurant food while you travel.
