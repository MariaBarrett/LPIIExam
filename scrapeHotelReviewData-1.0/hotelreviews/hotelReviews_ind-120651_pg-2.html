ReviewText:After traveled for 20 hours on a plane, my relatives found out that the hotel had sold their room to somebody else even though they prepaid for 11 nights. They were sent to a hotel 5 minutes away and had to repack then returned the next day. Hotel provided taxi vouchers which no taxi drivers were willing to accept. Hyatt Regency front desk had to pay cash to get the driver to take us instead of waiting any longer, The bell captain at the other hotel had to spend10 minutes to convince another cab to take me back to Hyatt Regency. Why sign up with a taxi company that will not accept them? Don't tell me that we are the first guests who had these experience. It only meant that your hotel is not up to the standard to offer excellent service to your guest. When we checked in, there were other guests who got the same problem. So that means you must have oversold a lot! As a matter of fact, the other guest said that he would never returned. Even the cab driver learned of our story said that your hotel is too greedy by overselling your rooms. -newline- Jose Fuentes, the assistant Front Office Manager, was the one who helped to check in my relatives. Even though he said that he was sorry, you could tell from his facial expression that he did not mean it nor care a bit about the inconvenience brought to my relatives. I drove 3 hours to the airport , then the hotel and had not had dinner at 8pm. I could not believe such a "high class????" hotel would give such a first hand impression to visitors who are a good source of income to the US economy. Even though they did not charge for the night, but that was not what my relatives wanted. They wanted a room where they could check in right away and laid on the beds to relax. Since they prepaid the travel agency overseas, they had to go through the trouble to get a refund afterwards. So I was very upset and asked for some dinner vouchers to compensate for the additional inconvenience. Jose said hastily," You want dinner, let's go to the restaurant now!" He acted as if we were trying to take advantage of the hotel. Come on. Visitors who spent thousands of dollars really want to benefit a meal. -newline- I also cannot believe that the hotel does not have coffee pot in the room and the guest has to request it. We hated that we had to stay dressed up and wait for the delivery. For a lot of people like my husband and myself, the first thing we want when out of bed is to have a cup of coffee. This is especially important to travelers who have jet lag. -newline- Just want to advise other guests not to be fooled by this hotel by its star rating. It definitely does not deserve it. I give 2 stars for the location close to tourist attraction and the look of the lobby.

ReviewText:My only complaint was that the rooms on the North facing side suffer from a lot of traffic noise from the busy street below.

ReviewText:Nice and cozy hotel. Built in a good area, i enjoyed it except i like the Hyatt house better. That hotel had a complimentary dinner and breakfast buffet that i thought this Hyatt would have but it didn't. I also didn't know i had to pay for self park or valet but overall for staying there one night it was a really good hotel

ReviewText:Buyer beware. I was given a room on the 5th floor overlooking the pool. Everything was going fine until they started playing the music at the bar. It felt like my bed was on top of the most powerful set of speakers in the world and to top that a crowd of people were chit chatting in front of the pool making the stay unbearable. Do not take any of the lower level rooms.
