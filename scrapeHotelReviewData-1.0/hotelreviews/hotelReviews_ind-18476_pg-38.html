ReviewText:We were on our way home following a week in the city and a side trip to Las Vegas.  This location was great for proximity to the airport.  Staff friendly, room nice and clean.  Complimentary breakfast very good.

ReviewText:The hotel was very convenient to the airport. The walls were thin and the noise from nearby rooms and the airport were somewhat bothersome. Comfortable and clean rooms.

ReviewText:My boyfriend and I stayed here one night while visiting LA from San Diego on our way to San Francisco. It was clean and service was friendly. However, when I tried to use the shower, I moved the shower curtain an inch and the whole rod came tumbling down, because it was broken. We were leaving and did not have an issue, but if they had tried to charge us, I would have not been happy. Overall, as a place to shower and sleep for a night, Hacienda worked out well.

ReviewText:Convenient to the airport, grocery stores, Walgreens, and public transportation.  Had breakfast each morning in the restaurant within the hotel--eggs, bacon, etc.--great value.  Room was clean and staff courteous.  Free shuttle to and from airport.  Overall a positive experience.

ReviewText:All of the hotel staff were freindly and helpful from the van that picked us up at the airport to the registration desk, to the bell staff. The room rates are very reasonable for this location. We will use this hotel anytime we need to layover between flights at LAX

ReviewText:The outside of the building looks great, but that's where the compliments stop. -newline-  -newline- The inside is falling apart. Ceiling tiles are water damaged, the carpet in the hallways smell of mold, and when riding in the elevator, you need to pray that it does not break down.
