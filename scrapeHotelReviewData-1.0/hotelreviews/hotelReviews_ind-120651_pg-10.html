ReviewText:The Hyatt was ok, the rooms were good size and the balcony was great.  No coffee maker in the room or bathrobes.  When I called to get them it took five hours for them to bring it, 11:00pm and we were already in bed.      Room service didn't get our order right on any occasion.      Bathroom light was inadequate.      Nightstand light was burned out.      Had to pay to much for internet.      No other coffee except for Starbucks and I don't like that brand.

ReviewText:The Hyatt Regency hotel was beyond all expectations of accommodation for a last minute flight to LA.       After being greeted by the friendly staff at reception and throughout the hotel, I was even more impressed by the quality and cleanliness of the stylish and spacious room. The modern artwork, plasma TV and incredible bathroom was enough to excite me; not to mention the ample storage space, classy furniture, and beyond crisp white curtains, an outdoor sitting area that overlooked Ave of the Stars and it's wonderful water fountain.       Upon being ridiculously clueless in asking what i should see while in LA, the staff were more than willing to share ideas, recommendations and even went to the trouble of getting me safely in a taxi with a list of directions. The hotel is only an inexpensive taxi ride away from the beach, Hollywood Blvd and plenty of shopping opportunities, including a mall and movie theatre (which are in walking distance).       At night, the hotel comes alive with clubbers and party people..and when thats all over, retreating to your room and ordering a delicious room service meal totally tops off the Hyatt Regency experience.       Polite service, practical rooms and pleasant surprises are all found at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza.

ReviewText:The Hyatt lived up to it's quality. Although, I only stayed for one night the Hotel is beautiful and the staff was great. I have only one complaint. The price for one night was reidiculous. I realize I was paying for location and the price was comparable around town. Other than that, I would stay at the Hyatt again. The Hotel is right around the corner from Beverly Hills and not very far from Hollywood.

ReviewText:The Hyatt Regency Century Plaza has remained consistently good during my 25+ years of stays. The staff is courteous and efficient, the rooms are clean and constantly upgraded and the overall experience has always met or exceeded my expectations.           The location is also very convenient to everything.  The lobby is a great place to just relax -- morning and evening.  The addition of an actual Starbucks is also a great feature.           Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again when my travels call for an LA trip.
