ReviewText:we arrived 15 minutes early, we retrieved a parking pass, then at 2 pm check in time the room was not ready till 2:45 pm we arrived early to be sure we would have our room on time, and they offered no alternative room. Poor communication skills. The parking is awful it is quite a distance from the lobby. More than a city block. You have to find a place to park on the street, get your pass then drive your car to parking lot.

ReviewText:I thought it was great that staff were eager to accomodate. They had me placed in a room down some other part of the hotel.. a part I don't especially like, they changed my room with no questions asked and were pleasant about it!!

ReviewText:We stayed just one night after flying to LA from Paris, France, and had an early morning flight to Hawaii, where we live.  So we were very tired and needed a comfortable place to sleep close to LAX.  The Hacienda fit the bill very nicely.  The food in the restaurant was very good and very reasonably priced and it opens at 5:00 a.m. The complimentary shuttle to LAX runs 24 hours.

ReviewText:great location, but that was about it. Staff did not know how to explain things, not very friendly. they close the pool at sunset, which i think is too early...we came back to the hotel shortly after sunset, and we did not even get to see the pool. We stayed on the 7th floor, and all the windows in the hallway were open without any screens. we did not have children with us, but it can be a safety issue when small children are around. service was not good as well at their restaurant. we decided not to come back here again. for the price we paid for our room, i was expecting much more, and I have stayed at the hotels where they have better service for much more reasonable prices.
