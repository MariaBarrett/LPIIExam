ReviewText:Hotel was okay but nothing special. Fine if you just need a clean place to spend the night

ReviewText:I was completely satisfied with my room. The location was very convenient. A Denny's diner associated with the motel was very helpful for me since it's open 24-hours a day and had a broad menu. I had irregular meal hours and was able to get good meals there. The downside was the motel did not have a complimentary breakfast. But Denny's gave a 10% discount to motel guests and a 15% discount for AARP members.

ReviewText:This is a travel motel in Sherman Oaks that is close to everything by car. The accommodations are good and functional and meet the value you pay.

ReviewText:On arrival the hotel looked average but the staff made it a little better than that. The room had a few issues but nothing to be upset about...just needs some updating and a little special attention in certain areas. The only REAL PROBLEM that we had is that the days we allowing our room to be cleaned were the days that our keys didn't work when we returned in the early morning tired and wanting to go straight o bed! There is no way to call the front desk unless you use your personal phone and then they tell you to come get the key at the front desk which was clear across the property for us and after walking a country mile for lack of finding parking....REALLY! Needless to say, we went without housekeeping services for 2 of the nights that we were there.

ReviewText:I liked the location, it was close to most major attractions, with very easy access to the highways. The staff was very nice. They were having some construction on sections of the hotel, but that did not interfere with our comfort. I would stay here again and recommend this place to others.

ReviewText:We were pleased with our room and the location of this hotel. The pricing was very good considering we we in LA. We did run into one problem and that was we had no air conditioning due to some construction taking place that somehow disturbed it just before we arrived. However it was a pleasant day and we were not uncomfortable. And they offered us compensation by way of room price reduction. So all in all a good experience.

ReviewText:I have always stayed on the second floor of the main area. I have never stayed in the tower rooms. There is some road noise, being placed in between a freeway, and two major thoroughfares, but it's not something I really notice much. I did hear a lot of fire engines last time I was there though, so there might be a fire station nearby that will interrupt your peace. -newline-  -newline- The rooms have always been very clean, though occasionally you'll see something like the towel bars are a bit loose on the walls. -newline-  -newline- Never noticed any bad odors, no weird stains on the sheets or carpet. That's pretty much the extent of my pickiness. -newline-  -newline- Sometimes the hot water in the shower takes a while to get hot. But it does get there. And I have yet to stay in a room where the exhaust fan in the bathroom looks like it's actually working, that being said, I've never seen any traces of mold or mildew in the bathrooms. -newline-  -newline- The Denny's in the parking lot offers a discount with your room key, so that's nice. And the parking lot itself, while having somewhat tight spaces, I've only not been able to find parking in front of my room once in about four stays.

ReviewText:I had a pleasant stay there for 2 days. The room is clean and comfortable, with its own heater. I read the previous reviews that parking could be a problem, but I did not experience any difficulty. The staff are very nice and helpful, and when I asked about whether they have discounted tickets to Universal Studios, they replied to me that their system has been down but they generally do sell these tickets. They directed us to a nearest Costco, and we got our year pass for 75 dollars each. -newline-  -newline- The location is GREAT. It is right off highway and the local traffic was pretty smooth. (compared to the huge traffic load close to downtown) It is a good compromise between the hollywood attractions/theme parks and the beautiful beaches (santa monica, venice, mahatten), all within 20 mins driving.

ReviewText:The hotel was quiet even though it was near the highway. I was a nice room and the staff was very helpful.

ReviewText:The facility had a fire in the storage area a couple of months ago and the water heating system does not work well. I don't know if this is the cause for the poor water heating system. Our showers were "lukewarm", the shower head did not work well, and the tub drained extremely slow.
