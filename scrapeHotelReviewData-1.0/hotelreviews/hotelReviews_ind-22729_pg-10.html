ReviewText:My stay at the hotel was excellent. The staff was friendly, the rooms were great, and the location was just what I needed (10 minute walk from Disney Concert Hall). -newline- The only thing I didn't like was when I called to have the complimentary shuttle come pick me up at Union Station I waited 25 minutes before I decided to just catch a cab. This was annoying to me because the cab ride was about 10 minutes, meaning that was about how far the hotel shuttle had to drive. -newline- All around though, it was a good stay at a classy hotel.

ReviewText:Very nice hotel, but I didn't like how they charged for parking and internet access. They even charged me $5 for a bottled water that was already placed in my room and that was at room temperature! If they didn't charge these fees for things that should be complimentary than I would rate it the best. But these common things having charges on them makes me give it a 3

ReviewText:We took this trip to go to Universal Studios. The location of this hotel was perfect .It was only about 10 mins away and it was located in a clean safe area. The trip was great and we even stayed an extra day because we loved the hotel so much.The price we ended up getting from Orbitz was incredible...

ReviewText:- ambiance and environment are quiet nice in common areas, they have a pretty little garden and waterfall on the lower rooftop -newline- - front desk staff was friendly and helpful in recommending things to do in LA and supplying various maps -newline- - bed and sheets were comfortable and newer. everything was clean and housekeeping is friendly -newline- - room is old, the hotel is definitely saving money by trying to repair room items. i.e., mismatching chairs in room, lamps have mismatching switches, shower is very narrow (smaller than standard) and there are marks on walls/tiles where things such as a soap dish used to be attached -newline- - hallway is very humid (they save air conditioning in hallways and turn it off in rooms so when you first enter it feels uncomfortably muggy and smells of stale air) -newline- - there is no easy place to reach an outlet in the room (i.e., for charging cell phone or plugging in laptop)... the two room outlets are hidden by heavy furniture such as the bed and drawers.
