ReviewText:We had a great time, but I feel that I could not do anything in the hotel as it was so expensive, from $30 breakfasts to $10 bottles of water. If it had been reasonably priced, it would have been a much better experience.

ReviewText:The purpose of my trip was to visit with family and relax for a few days. It was perfect for this purpose since the pool lounge chaises were so comfortable and the poolside service was prompt and friendly. The food and drinks were delicious. I found everyone I dealt with to be very service-oriented with a friendly and pleasant attitude. Would recommend it to anyone looking for a quality accommodation.

ReviewText:The location of the Hotel was great for distance to shopping.  The Hotel itself was not impressive.  We rented a car for our visit so that we could drive down the PCH.  Upon arriving at the Hotel we were informed that parking would be an additional $29.00 per day.  Unfortunately we did not include that in our budget.  In addition the staff was anything but friendly.  When checking in it seemed as if it was almost a bother for them to take care of us.  When we inquired about a particular restaurant the young man checking us in hadn't heard of it and didn't bother to ask any of the other staff if they had.  There were four of us traveling together (all woman)  and when we called housekeeping to order extra towels they told us they would send them up.  They never did.  And we could enjoy breakfast from the room service menu for only $38.00 per person.  A little pricey in my estimation.  All in all we would not stay at this Hotel again.  Wouldn't mind paying the extra money if the service was superb.  Not here.

ReviewText:Went 11 nights for a film festival and though the festival itself was across town in the downtown area, our stay at the hotel was extremely pleasant with friendly staff and impeccable accommodations. Stayed in the towers with a balcony that overlooked the Beverly Hills area. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a stay at a classy hotel.

ReviewText:My husband and I were visiting our son, a grad student at UCLA.We thoroughly enjoyed the Beverly Hilton thanks to a great package - flight from DC and hotel - [...].  they offered a $40 per night upgrade to a "better room" which we accepted and did not regret.  Had a 6th floor room overlooking Beverly Hills, plasma TV (great for watching the World Cup !), beautiful tiled bathroom with separate toilet area, l'Occitane toiletries replenished every day, quiet room, super comfortable King size bed, the works...Only thing i would say about the room:  free wireless internet would be appreciated (had to pay $11.95 per day) and a coffee station in the room would be great (since we did not want to pay $23 for continental breakfast at the hotel we found a Starbucks within a 3 min walk.Be forewarned that if you have a rental car you will have to pay $29 for parking at the hotel which is common in LA but still outrageous.Other than that the pool area is beautiful and relaxing, the service excellent.  Would go there again definitely !
