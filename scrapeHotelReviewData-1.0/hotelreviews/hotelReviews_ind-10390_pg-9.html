ReviewText:Very good experience. Disappointed that there was a charge of 9.95$ per day for wifi connection. Smaller less grand hotels stayed in the previous couple of weeks previous wifi was FREE.

ReviewText:The Biltmore is gorgeous, with ornate ceilings and antique furniture. However, the guest rooms do not share the large and elegant style as the first floor of the hotel. It was a nice stay, and reasonably priced.

ReviewText:The lobby, restaurants, and meeting rooms are beautiful...but be ready for a bit of a sparse room. All amenities were there, but the room was a bit small and very basic. -newline- Also, be ready for a $40 fee for your car, unless you want to pay each time you enter/exit the building. -newline- The entrance was very hard to find, it's small and not marked well. I had to drive around the block twice before I was able to pull in. -newline- On the positive side, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The food was great in the restaurant. I would stay again in the future.

ReviewText:My girlfriend and I decided to chose the Millennium Biltmore Hotel (MBH) as a romantic labor day weekend getaway. -newline-  -newline- Hotel Description: -newline- The MBH in the description was noted to be unique in the hotel market of downtown LA. It described it's amenities as first class and it's rooms as a perfect romantic getaway. The pictures included we beautiful as it showed it's rooms as picturesque. -newline-  -newline- Hotel Grounds: -newline- When we arrived at the MBH, I was taken away by the romantic style of the hotel. The high vaulted ceilings, the greeco/romanesque planes, and orate fixtures. As I walked around and I was very impressed with the hotel grounds. -newline-  -newline- Standard Room: -newline- When my girlfriend and I arrived at the room, I found that the description/picture of the room that was advertised was very different. Instead of a plush Napoleonic style bed, it was a standard king size and the room had an assortment of furniture, that seemed to be placed there for use. It that the hotel spent so much time with the physical attraction to the rest of the hotel, but left the standard rooms with spartan settings. The shower and bathroom was that of what I can find at a motel and I had trouble figuring out the settings on the shower dial. -newline-  -newline- Hotel Staff: -newline- Here is where I give the hotel top credit. The staff were very helpful in helping me find transportation, and would try to go above and beyond in helping guests out. For example, when I needed to find transportation and print tickets to Disneyland, the staff not only gave me great advice and produced maps of how to get there, they even printed out my tickets and told me of great deals to look out for. -newline-  -newline- Lastly, the hotel food, in both the restaurant and room service was excellent. The staff were were very observant and helpful. Although I wish I had time to sample their Afternoon Tea, from what I observed it was excellent. -newline-  -newline- Conclusion: -newline- Overall the hotel itself was pretty good. The staff, location, and price was excellent. My only gripe is that I wish they would upgrade the standard rooms to being more on par with the rest of the hotel.

ReviewText:I typically do not write reviews, however, due to the theft / hotel staff's feigned inability to find my iPad, iPod and associated charger, and a MacBook charger, I felt compelled to write this review. -newline-  -newline- I stayed at the Biltmore on the nights of the 21st and 22nd of August for work purposes. I was rushed as I was checking out on the 23rd and I mistakenly left those items charging on the floor next to the bed. I admit that leaving the items behind was my fault, however, in the past week, I have been repeatedly calling about these missing items and on multiple occasions, the security staff have acted as if they had never heard of my case, failed to return phone calls, claim that names of supervisors that I had been given do not actually work at the hotel, and in one call, put me on hold a minimum of 6 times in order to take calls from other people also complaining about missing items. Their security staff have done very little, if anything at all, to investigate the missing items when it is clear that someone from the cleaning or valet staff must have stolen my things. Usually, the Millennium chain of hotels is a respected and reputable chain. However, in my case, their staff have stolen close to $1000 worth of my property and the security and management staff have done little more than tell me that it is not in their lost and found. This is unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber and I urge you not to stay here if this is how the management treats its guests.

ReviewText:Our second time @ the Biltmore (if you don't count that we were married there 34 years ago!). Normally a well run hotel, it let us down this time. The line for check-in was out the door (took over 20 minutes to get to a clerk). The concierge apologized for the wait and explained that the hotel was understaffed but that she could not access the reservations system herself. The water urn left out for guests (keeping in mind it was 105 degrees outside) was empty and the concierge told me that the "water service" had ended for the day and they were waiting for a service person to take it away and we could not get more water. -newline-  -newline- Once into the room, though, we were pleased with the furnishings and amenities. The housestaff personnel were friendly and efficient. -newline-  -newline- We would like to give the Biltmore another opportunity to accommodate us however this experience left a bitter taste in our mouths. As noted earlier, our ties run deep with the Biltmore - in fact, my wife worked for the ad agency Chiat/Day in the 1970's, which was the second floor of the Biltmore Hotel! -newline-  -newline- Thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my views and concerns.
