ReviewText:For the price, this hotel was very conveniently located. Given that we had to leave early, we were happy it was located near a restaurant that served an early breakfast. On the downside, it was very dated and noisy ( our room was on the street side). Also, the bed was not so comfy.

ReviewText:I went to visit the beach and a helicopter expert called Rotor f/x. The only thing that I could find wrong about the location was the heat. I am from Arizona so I don't need to come to Cali and still be hot, I can get that from where I am from. This visit was just like the other visits I have had, enjoyable.
