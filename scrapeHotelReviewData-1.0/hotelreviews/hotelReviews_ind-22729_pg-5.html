ReviewText:-Shop, eat, and attend relative's memorial service in/around Japan town.  we are repeaters. -newline- -To the hotel management:  Bathroom is clean but shower curtain doesn't smell good.  I think some of the customer complaints "moldy smell" come from shower curtains.

ReviewText:Rooms are nice and clean, beds are super comfortable. Free wifi would be awesome, as well as a pool but the rooftop garden is a rare find in LA so it has that going for it. -newline-  -newline- Bar staff was really friendly!

ReviewText:The hotel lobby is beautiful so when I arrived my first impression was very positive.  Although this hotel must have been glamorous long time ago, it is not the case today.  The rooms are large enough and clean, but dated.  Bathrooms are very small. Two restaurants and a bar near the garden (nice, but small) are closed down. I felt the hotel was somewhat abandoned. Quiet, but not in an enjoyable way. Good price for the location.

ReviewText:The hotel was nice looking and it was the perfect location for checking out Little Tokyo, Chinatown, the beach, and etc. I like the oriental design of the lobby. As for the guest rooms, the negative thing is the bed was made with no fitted sheet. They just put another topped sheet on top and tucked it in. And the bathroom floor was dirty. I really like that we are right in Little Tokyo because we spent most of our time walking around Little Tokyo, checking out the shops, the restaurants, and the Nisei Festival. Everything is within walking distance and also they have a grocery store near too. It would be great if there was a microwave in the hotel so I can reheat food that I've bought and couldn't finish. We also checked out Chinatown (which is like 5 to 10 minutes driving distance) and the beach!

ReviewText:This is the second stay at the Kyoto Grand for my boyfriend and I and it fit exactly what we were looking for - a nice but no-fuss quick stay before meeting up with my family.  I like the Kyoto Grand's downtown location which is only 15 mins away from my folk's in the San Gabriel Valley.  The two times we'd stayed, our single rooms were tastefully appointed, clean and quiet.  The front desk staff were efficient and helpful, the parking attendants gave easy directions. My boyfriend used the gym and found it sufficient for our quick stay.  We love that we don't have to drive anywhere to enjoy the restaurants and convenient markets in Japantown.
