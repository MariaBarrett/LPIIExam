ReviewText:Upon apprival the line for check in was 45min wait. Secondly the parking was not the best _seperate lot barely enough spots for the guests after being charged additional Parking fee after already paying for the hotel before arriving.

ReviewText:I was very upset with my experience. I reserved a room three days in advance, and I called the day of to make sure that my reservation is secured. The lady over the phone assured me that everything was fine but when I get there they turn me away and say that their rooms are booked! I couldn't believe it, I don't even know how that's possible. I was disgusted with their performance.

ReviewText:Young couple. Leisure. -newline- Pros- Price, location (near lax and our dinner location), internet area and adjacent bar/cantina Rudy's & cafe -newline-  -newline- Cons-NO A/C (front desk told me to open the window), windows really old/cracked/broken (room #1887), $8 a night off-site parking, staff didn't communicate the area(no mention of Rudy's or the cafe. We accidentally walked by them as we returned late night), water pressure in shower really low, elevator was nostalgic of a 1970's closet, walls PAPER THIN!!! guests in adjacent room we're very "noisy". Will not return. Do not recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:Pretty good deal for 60 bucks. Room was nice, and clean. Pillows were hard though, and and a flat screen tv would be nice. Other than that I had no issues.

ReviewText:It was really terrible. I arrived one hour earlier and the lady at the front desk said that my room was not clean yet. She asked if I would like to have another room (ready, clean, etc), same category, I said yes and... -newline- She gave me the worst room in the hotel (I don't think there is something worst). The odor was so horrible and when I realized my shoes were making noises when I walked it. The carpet was completely wet and it should had been like that for days because the smell was so so so horrible. I was really angry with this. -newline- They moved me to another but still the smell around was horrible. I really didn't like it

ReviewText:I've stayed at the Hacienda many times. Their centralized healing and cooling, which means you only have control in your room once the heating or cooling is turned on, can be a problem. I nearly froze my posterior off in the fall before they turned the heat on and it was quite cold. -newline-  -newline- Overall, the reasonable rate and convenience to the airport - plus their shuttle, makes it the best choice for me when I travel to L.A.

ReviewText:Not a 3-star - maybe 2 or 2.5. Airport shuttle service was below average in terms of wait time on both ends. Dated facilities. OK for the price, but not great.
