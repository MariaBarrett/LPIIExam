ReviewText:We basically wanted a place near LAX for an early AM flight for a fair price, and we were not disappointed. The bedding and bed were very comfortable. The common areas of the hotel were nicer than we expected but the rooms only standard. We would stay there again under similar circumstances.

ReviewText:Honestly.... I hope I save you some time. This hotel is awful. Staff is bad.. Rooms are outdated. The parking is awful and our TV didnt even work. I have nothing positive to say about this place. Spend the extra $20 on any other hotel but this one. Blah!

ReviewText:This place is a lovely old hotel, well-run, good front-desk staff and concierges, friendly shuttle-drivers...clean comfy rooms. It's only about 10 minutes from LAX by shuttle/car ~ close enough for efficiency but far enough not to hear the roars. Nice pool and gardens, gorgeous tiled courtyards with fountains. Right across the street from a very good 24-hour supermarket (Ralph's), a Walgreen's and a wide variety of eateries. I will definitely stay there when in LA and particularly when I need to be near LAX. This place is very good value for the money.

ReviewText:It's an older hotel, but clean and well-kept. A/C worked well, and it is so close to LAX that it takes away the stress of getting up and fighting a lot of LA traffic on the morning of the flight out.
