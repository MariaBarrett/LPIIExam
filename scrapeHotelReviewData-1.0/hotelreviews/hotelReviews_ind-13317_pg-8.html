ReviewText:The hotel was awesome..  I stayed here with my son, as we were heading to Universal Studios.Got it for a 30% discounted rate, however, the regular price of $159 a night would have been just fine under normal circumstances.  The pillows were way better than anything I've ever slept on and the sheets were soft as well. The bed was comfortable and the room was tip top. The "shuttle service" was actually a Lincoln Towncar, and shuttled us to and from the park. I would stay here again, and will.  Definitely recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:Our stay at the hotel started out rough when they didn't pick us up at 10:00 at the airport because they said that they shut the shuttle down at !0:00 but after that the hotel was a 5 star experience with a grocery store across the street and being right in the middle of all the excitement around Hollywood while being in a very safe neighborhood with easy access to the LA metro system which took us everywhere we wanted to go. But what we enjoyed about the hotel the most is how nice the employees were. The employees helped us with great suggestions and advice of great things to do and great restaurants to visit. Also they were very interested in how our trip was going. It is a wonderful hotel.

ReviewText:This hotel is in a convenient location in relation to Universal Studios (about a 10 minute drive), and you don't have the typical traffic associated with being near a main attraction.  The rooms were clean and comfortable, and staff members were friendly and helpful.  In addition the overnight valet parking fee ($28) is relatively cheap in comarison to other major metropolitan areas (i.e. San Francisco).  Lastly, the restaurant across the street (Bea Bea's) has the best breakfast this side of the Mississippi!!!  I'm not trying to take business away from the hotel's restaurant, but visitor's have to try Bea Bea's. We will definitely stay at the Hotal Amarano during our next visit to the Burbank/Hollywood area.

ReviewText:It was a great hotel-except for the road construction detour in front of hotel. Would not recommend if you have children-would call it  an adult hotel. Very nice large rooms ultra nice bar. Would stay here again.
