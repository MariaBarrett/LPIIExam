ReviewText:My boyfriend and I stayed one night at the Biltmore Hotel for my birthday. [...] We are from Long Beach so we just needed a place to stay so we didn't have to drive. Upon arrival we were amazed at the interior of the hotel which was so ellegant. Three weddings were going on which were the most beautiful and I personally admire since thats my career path and for one hotel to be able to prepare for 3 weddings at once, thats wonderful. The service was great, friendly and fast check in. The bar opened at 4 right when we arrived and had some cocktails, on the pricey side but we expected that. We ended up at the bar at the end of the night as well with wonderful jazz music and delicious late night food. Overall was a great experience, however one down side...$40 to park your car over night for guests. I think thats a little ridiculous.

ReviewText:Beautiful hotel. Our shower floor was kind of chipped and the TV was oooooold school, other than that, it was awesome. so much to do w/in walking distance. parking at the hotel was $40 a night, kinda a lot. -newline- GREAT pool with a sauna and steamroom! sooo relaxing.

ReviewText:What a gorgeous, historic hotel! We got a great deal on a spacious double room. Everything was clean and well maintained, the hotel staff was nice and helpful, and the cafe served wonderful food. The beds were also super comfortable. We would definitely stay again!

ReviewText:Though the lobby and restaurants were very charming in their old-school glamour, the room was not.  The photos shown here are for 'concierge' upgraded rooms, not the regular-rate rooms.  They should be more clear about that.  It was a stark difference.

ReviewText:we love this hotel. and our room this time was terrific. the only reason we don't give you 5 stars is that your concierge was not only unhelpful, but pretty clueless. better luck next time.

ReviewText:The service was really good until we found out that we need to pay more for the extra bed and no one told us about this before when we booked the room. so they charged extra 30$ for the rolling bed. but in general, the hotel is nice but it's not the family type, more the business type.
