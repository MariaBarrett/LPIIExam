ReviewText:We were so pleased with the whole stay and the food was ridiculously great!!! Great servers, and housekeeping was awsome....Room service was kickin' and the staff was always extremely helpful and courteous!!!!  :)  My fiance and I will stay there again if and when travelling to LA in the future., and we will refer our friends and family to Hacienda Hotel. The courtyards are in perfect shape and the flowers are beautiful and just so well taken care of....the staff is cleaning and tending to the guests 24/7......Can't compare and will stay here again......

ReviewText:We were given a tiny room on the 2nd floor over the street right next to the elevator that was so noisy we could never have slept, so we requested a different room. Both of us are handicapped, and the hotel staff knew this, but the new room was a huge hike to a separate part of the hotel then another huge hike from the elevator. There was no refrigerator for my meds, so we requested one. When it arrived it was so old and filthy we were disgusted. -newline- If I could have just left, I would have.

ReviewText:I had an interview at a corporation just down the street. The staff were friendly and helpful and I liked the set up of the room. The room was clean and stocked. The only set back I have to say anything about is the view...my room on the 6th(?) floor of the southern tower had a view of the hotel dumpster. While not idyllic, it was a nice and restful place for my brief trip. I would recommend it if you are in the L.A. area and have plans near LAX because of it's convenient location.

ReviewText:We were very pleased with our room, not with the parking arrangements, especially the distance from parking lot to the room.  I think it is possible to improve this by assigning temporary parking for checking-in, and different parking lots for different wings of the hotel.  Also making sure is only one car per room.

ReviewText:It was such a warm hotel.  Many areas to just sit outside and read, talk with other travelers or your own party.  Nice restaurant right next door and many across the street. The hotel shuttle was great, they took you to local attractions for free and had the airport shuttle to and from.  I wish when we go back next year we could find one closer to where we need to be because we would go in a heart beat!  The price was such a steal for what we had!

ReviewText:Our room was not clean.   The shower (hot and cold nobs were reversed) and toilet were so noisy.  My brother got bitten by some insect in his bed.

ReviewText:Booked a de luxe room and was quite disappointed with what we got.  Needed a major refurbishment.  Nevertheless, met the need for a reasonable value overnight airport hotel.

ReviewText:Very convenient shuttle service to LAX.  Parking was ok. When I went to plug in my computer behind night stand next to bed, there was an empty condom wrapper.  At least it was empty.  Maybe rooms could be checked better.  Have stayed her before, didn't like the location of room.  Probably will not stay again.

ReviewText:The experience was great. I got around well and the hotel was located in the perfect place. Freeways were close. Everything you needed was right there, in walking or driving distance.  I would go back
