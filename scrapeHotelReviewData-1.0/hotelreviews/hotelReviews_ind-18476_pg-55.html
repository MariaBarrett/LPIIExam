ReviewText:We had a great stay at the Hacienda Hotel and would recommend it to everyone! Clean rooms, friendly staff and a fast shuttle to LAX right in the middle of the night. You will get a lot for your money!

ReviewText:Is it very close to the airport and that made it convient! For a quick trip it works great but would not recommend it for a vacation.

ReviewText:The Hacienda hotel was such a dump, I left as soon as I could. Staff was nice enough but this place is a pit. Even though I was only mildly repulsed at check-in (exterior is rundown); the minute I saw my room, I left.

ReviewText:THE HACIENDA HOTEL WAS DISAPPOINTING IN MANY WAYS. . FIRST OF ALL WHEN WE WALKED INTO OUR ROOM THERE WAS A MUSTY ORDER.  WE ASKED THE MAID FOR A ROOM SPRAY AND THAT HELPED.  AT 11:30 P.M. THERE WAS SO MUCH NOISE COMING FROM THE COURTYARD I CALLED SECURITY TO COMPLAIN.  I CALLED AGAIN AT 12:30 A.M. AND AGAIN AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 A.M.  SECURITY CAME AND POUNDED ON OUR DOOR AT ONE POINT. .I TOLD HIM THROUGH THE DOOR THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM THE COURTYARD. . NOT OUR ROOM.  WE HARDLY SLEPT A WINK ALL NIGHT.  I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE.

ReviewText:I was on my way to Anaheim for a conference and my plane got to LAX late in the evening, so I was looking for a convenient location to spend the night.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, and there's a great pool and outside seating area. The room was very clean and smoke free.  Free transportation to LAX, and it's only a few blocks from the airport, and it's easy walking distance to offsite restaurants.

ReviewText:From the outside this hotel does not look like much but once you pull in to the turnabout you will quickly realize that you are in for something special.  You walk into the main lobby and see people from what appears to be every nation, speaking in various languages, yet each person has the same familiar expression... a pleasantly surprised smile.      The hotel staff were quick to check us in and even  offered dining suggestions without being asked.  We opted for room service and I have to admit that in all the hotels we have ordered room service none compare to the this hotel.  They answered the phone quickly when called, gave a time when the food would be delivered, they exceeded expectation by delivering it well before their stated time, AND the food was HOT and GOOD!      The bed was very nice and quite soft, yet supportive.  The bathroom was a bit small but the hot water was hot immediately and the room was well ventilated.      The only down side was parking.  It's across the street but in reality it was a very short walk, 2-3 minutes.  The upside to the parking situation was the patrol that was visible both when we arrived and when we left.      If you are fortunate to have a room overlooking the atrium you are in for a treat.  The water fountain is amazing beautiful and the entire patio was pleasantly situated.      All in all my wife and I were very surprised.  We've never heard of Hacienda Hotel and questioned if we should stay there.  After our experience, there is no question where we will stay when we're in the area.

ReviewText:The hotel itself was beautiful.  Nice courtyard, good pool, pretty garden.  The neighborhood was good, quiet, and felt safe.  My only disappointment was that it was not too accessible to tourist places, unless you rent a car.  Then parking at hotel was always full, so had to park in additional hotel parking across the street (behind gas station) - also pretty full most of time. But that's pretty much true for LA not just the hotel.  Hotel was very close to LAX.  They have a rental service by check-in.  Internet access in the lobby as well.  The adjoining restaurant Mariposa was nice, people there were very friendly.  Breakfast was great.  Had a problem with the toilet in my room.  When I advised them - maintenance fixed it right away.  The staff handling guest services could have been more helpful, they barely answered my questions about where to go but the rest of the staff was friendly and helpful.  Overall, I really enjoyed my stay with my 8-yr-old daughter - we felt safe (highly important factor).

ReviewText:The Hacienda Hotel is very close to the LAX airport,maybe 10minutes. The hotel has a new and old buildings.My son and I shared a room with 2 queen beds that were in the old part of the hotel.We stayed for 6 nights.The room had a little outside deck area which over looked a parking area for delivery drivers.But the noise wasn't a distraction. The room did not have a micowave oven,or a small fridge and the only sink was in the small bathroom.The coffee pot was only enough for 1 cup,and tasted like hotel coffee.The room was only big enough for 2 adults and the end of the beds were very close to the tv stand,dresser,and that 1 extra chair.There was a standard room desk with a lamp,phone,and that 1 cup coffee pot.The closet was big enough for 4 suitcases plus allot of area for our hang up clothes.More  hangers were needed.Bathroom was standard,plenty of hot water.The air conditioner had 4 settings and worked great.Parking was $5.00 a day.24 hour room service,food was just ok.

ReviewText:It served my purpose very well. I needed to break up a trip to and from New Zealand. Their shuttle service to LAX was quite good. Staff was friendly and courteous. Not expensive, but quite comfortable.

ReviewText:A very large hotel with many, about 650,  rooms. Reasonably clean, in a busy area, with very crowded access to the lobby and front desk. Stayed two periods. One in the west tower - older smaller room with an uncomfortable bed but had a refrigerator in the room. Second atay was in the south tower - larger room with a bigger, comfortable bed but no fridge. Parking was a problem - they first wanted to charge $5/night, then offered free parking in their lot. Then there was a problem with the card used to access the parking lot, blamed on the computer. Was a reasonably comfortable place to sleep, especially on the upper floors above the street noise and in the more comfortable south tower room, once past all the checkin and parking type frustrations.
