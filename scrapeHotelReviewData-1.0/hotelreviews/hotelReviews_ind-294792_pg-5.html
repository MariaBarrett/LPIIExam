ReviewText:I stayed at The Standard Downtown LA on the last day of our trip out to LA. We were within walking distance (2 to 3 blocks) of a grocery store, coffee shop, LA Live, and the freeway was very easy to get to by car. The staff was nice and the rooms were small but comfortable enough for 2 people. The hotel lobby and restaurant were serviceable and I would definitely visit the rooftop bar for a drink if I'm in the area again. I was disappointed with 2 of the amenities in the rooms.... 1. the TV stand was too low to the ground and so it was uncomfortable watching the TV from the bed. 2. internet was free but the wireless connection from the room was very bad so I could not get any work done during my stay. But overall, considering the price and the location (downtown LA not Hollywood, Bev Hills, or Santa Monica), I would definitely consider staying there again.

ReviewText:Standard is a great hotel. It lives up to the hype. Very private and quiet rooms. Great bed and high quality sheets! Very clean rooms and bathrooms. Room lighting is flexible: you can make it dim, sexy, moody or focused. Room service is priced a bit high though but the staff and service was excellent. If you want to save some money park your car a few blocks away from the hotel there are better deals for parking than the standard parking lot (rip off). Also there is a Famima (its like a 7-11) a block or two away open 24 hours. The neighborhood is safe to walk around.

ReviewText:Service and staff was great. Caters to mostly younger generation, I'm 62. But thats okay, young crowds are good. Television sits too low to the floor. Bed too low on the floor for watching tv from the bed. No waste can in the bathroom. Large counter across the main sleeping area but only one chair. This hotel is unique to say the least but for the price and location I would certainly come back.

ReviewText:saw LA for the first time, hotel was centrally located close all that downtown LA had to offer. The hotel was more of a business hotel, but the facilities were more then adequate. Compared to other trips we've taken, this hotel would rank somewhere in the middle, probably a 7/10

ReviewText:Hotel was clean and staff was nice.  Standard is anything but standard.  Television only worked about 50% of the time and the breakfast I ordered never showed up.

ReviewText:Yes, the decor is hip and the rooftop bar is fun if you're into that scene.  BUT the service is by far the worst I've experienced at any hotel.  No one helped us with our bags as we lugged them from the parking lot through crowds of drunk bar goers to the front desk to check in.  There was no courtesy parking during the checkin as in most hotels.  Housekeeping was problematic every day.  One day they did not come at all.  On the other days, soaps, towels and glasses were never replaced.  When these items were requested, they took hours to come and staff were unapologetic. -newline-  -newline- Still, the hotel is right near the metro, has free wifi, and has it's own club scene which is nice.

ReviewText:I found this hotel really funky and chic. The service was great with front of house staff being able to answer any questions I may have. The location was also good. The rooftop bar was amazing.
