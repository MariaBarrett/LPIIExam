ReviewText:The Biltmore underwent a huge renovation in the early 1980s.  It appears that this was the last time it's been updated. The common areas in the lobby are lovely.  The carpet in the hallways is threadbare.  The TVs in the rooms are circa. 1982.  The room was immaculate. Bed was comfortable and bedding was nice. No convenient outlets to plug in power supplies.  Plastic cups instead of drinking glasses.

ReviewText:Hotel lobby and public areas are beautiful and well preserved.  Guest rooms are very basic and feel a bit bare.  Guest bathrooms are also a bit cold and basic.  Overall good experience.  Wonderful downtown location.  Will stay again.  Thank you.

ReviewText:Just stayed one night. No problems with my reservation or with the room (other than the mattress was too soft; the room was a good size).  Pretty good location in downtown LA - across the street from outdoor ice-skating (not year-round) and the Metro.  I ordered room service breakfast - on time and a great value for all that I got.  The Biltmore is a beautiful classic. I was especially pleased at the rate I got!

ReviewText:This hotel is old, not taken care and somewhat dirty. Maybe it was nice at some point in time but not any longer. Service is extremely bad. We called the concierge (from our room) at least 4 times with no luck. We ended up walking down to the front desk and one of the front desk employees had to help us. He was very nice (the only one who could really provide any correct info). It seems that  besides this person (a dark skin very good looking man in his 30's) no one else could could  give you the right information. Where told (by one of the front desk employees as the concierge was never available) that the metro was good to ride, but in fact it was the worst. Homeless people call it home and you have to ride with them. We felt very unsafe at all times while staying there.  Simply, location is horrendous, specially if you  are in a vacation as we where. its far from all of the tourists attractions and its almost impossible if you dont have a car. Taxis are $25-$30 each way to where the action is. We could not wait for our 3 days to be over. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.

ReviewText:It looks like old Hollywood. The Valet is so great, they went out of their way. The rooms were a disappointment, however. They were bare and I even found someone's clothes folded in a drawer. I guess the cleaning crew forgot to check in there. The rest of the hotel was really great.

ReviewText:The Biltmore in many ways is a dream come true. Nestled in the heart of Down town Los Angeles, it is near the major districts of this city and with its interior masterpieces, it is no wonder this hotel is the home of many great movie scenes. And while all the glitz and glamor made this hotel a 4 star experience, the simple basics of hot water, electricity, etc were missing thusly making a motel 6 seem like a dream on a cold raining day. I do appreciate the beauty of this hotel, but the hot water was not working and on a raining day in LA, taking a cold shower is simply like standing on the street corner with arms opened wide. Will I stay at the biltmore again? Perhaps, but perhaps i will make sure to shower at the local gym first.
