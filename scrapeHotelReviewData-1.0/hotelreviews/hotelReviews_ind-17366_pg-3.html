ReviewText:I was visiting friends in Santa Monica and for the extra 15 minutes of driving, the Doubletree cost half as much for a superior room. I never ended up eating at the Doubletree, but I did make use of the weight room (all nice equipment) and the staff was very attentive. LA doesn't have many bargains in hotels...this is one of them.

ReviewText:The Doubletree is a beautiful hotel and a great value. It has a perfect location and is conveniently located for business, shopping and tourism. -newline- The only negatives: -newline- 1. $15.00 per day parking charge -newline- 2. Excessive linen damage charge of $150.00 because we got some tanning goop on a bed sheet. The solution is washable so the sheet was not really damaged.

ReviewText:This is actually a decent hotel. Quick check in and friendly staff. Generally a comfortable stay - but we were only there a night. I thought the hot water in the bathroom took longer than average to heat up and when it did, it wasn't particularly warm. The bathroom was also very small. Parking is $15 a night, which seems to be about average for the area. For the price we paid, I wish it would have included some type of free breakfast.

ReviewText:This hotel is popular with flight crews and foreign tourists departing/arriving LAX. Location near I-405 freeway makes getting around easy; plenty of parking (@ $15/day); rooms were clean and very comfortable with room-darkening curtains to let you oversleep if you want. 37" LG flat screens in every room with sat. TV access. Good value for L.A. Wait staff at lounge and restaurant were green and less attentive than I prefer, but otherwise this was a good value -- I will stay here again.

ReviewText:Well, the staff & breakfast were great, but that's where it ends. A staff member tried to help us find a satisfactory room, but all had a mildew sort of odor & malfunctioning/non-functioning sleep number beds. We felt bad for the staff member as it's obvious the property owner failed to place high enough priority on the rooms. We were shown between five and ten rooms and all were in need of renovation. My recommendation is to not book a room here if there are no photos of the rooms available for viewing and if the rooms in the photos do not appear to be newly renovated.

ReviewText:I booked a trip to LA which included a stay at Doubletree by Hilton (West Centinela Ave, Culver City). Although I booked it month and a half in advance and everything was paid, when we arrived at the front desk they told us "we have news for you. The hotel is fully booked, so we decided to move you to another place". They moved us to Hilton Hotel at the LAX Airport, which was really good, but the location sucks. It`s simply too far away. Every morning you have to drive a car at least an hour to get where you want. I know it`s LA, and if you want to go somewhere that you need a car, but for that money we spent for that Hotel, my friend was staying in a hotel which is a 10-minute walk from Walk of Fame! At Hilton, they gave us free parking for the whole stay and high-speed internet free of charge, as compensation for moving from one place to another. All in all, great experience and I would recommend it to anyone going to LA. But a car is a must!

ReviewText:We've stayed at numerous hotels of all types around the country and this was definitely one of the best values i've found. The hotel was clean, the rooms were clean, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly, they had a very nice (and also clean) pool with late hours, and the location was fantastic. Within 10 min of Marina Del Rey, 15 of Santa Monica/Venice, and 20 from Hollywood and Beverly Hills, there was no shortage of things to do or places to dine. You do have to pay for parking, but after asking, they had no problem giving us a discounted rate since we were staying more than one night. All around a very well managed hotel! Worth checking out.

ReviewText:Room was dirty. Dirty filthy under dressers! Rooms on 2nd floor not cleaned until 3:30 on 2nd floor. Looks like they reserve these rooms for orbitz and expedia. Booked once through both because of price-being honest. Used to strictly stay at Courtyard Marriott. Thought we would give it a try. They have room service at 6am. Let me tell you there is one small broken computer chair to eat at! Even with 2 people someone has to eat on bed-never seen anything like it. Why offer room service for more that 1? Who is gonna eat on the bed a full breakfast or lunch? No extra chair in room!
