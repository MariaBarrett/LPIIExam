ReviewText:Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Lemontrose Suites hotel for four days, the hotel was great. Our room was clean and comfy, the staff was extremely nice and made sure we always had what we needed. Their service was always prompt. The neighborhood was quiet and was just a few blocks from Santa Monica blvd and Sunset bldv. The beaches are about 30 minutes away and got a little expensive using taxi's. Our overall experience was perfect, we couldn't have asked for more. Also the rooftop pool and jacuzzi was on the smaller side but the views were great.

ReviewText:It was a good experience. Unfortunately, the Le Montrose hotel was under a renovation, which I didn't know at the time that I made my reservation. It's a good hotel, if you want to be centrally located in West Hollywood, and you don't plan to spend much time at the property. The staff was very friendly, but the property lacks atmosphere and social environments. The wine list was poor for a hotel at this price point.l

ReviewText:The location is very accessible to everything and parking is not a problem (street and in & out valet). Staff is very gay-friendly, courteous and accommodating compare to other metro cities and hotels we have stayed. Very prompt on getting your car ready in 5 mins. Rooms are clean but during the stay they are changing carpet in the hallways, but didn't affect the rooms. I will definitely stay in this hotel again.

ReviewText:I needed a centrally located West Hollywood Hotel that was close to the action, but also quiet and suitable to take my daughter. This was a perfect choice. Phenomenally friendly staff, delicious breakfast menu, small gym and lovely rooftop pool. Also loved that I could open the windows in our room to get cool morning and evening air.

ReviewText:This place was awesome! Stayed here my first time in Cali. Location is AMAZING, the sunset strip is right up the road, and Rodeo drive is a quick ride. -newline-  -newline- Rooms are very nice, only complaint is that they maybe should have vacuumed once over my four day stay. -newline-  -newline- Restaurant is small, but super nice. Rooftop pool is also small, but great view. Even better was the rooftop tennis court, got to play every morning (a nice workout). -newline-  -newline- Staff is very nice, and the valets work their a** off

ReviewText:Le Montrose is a short, few block walk, to all of the great restaurants, shops and nightlife of West Hollywood. It's located just far away (3-4 blocks) in a residential neighborhood that it feels like an oasis away from the craziness. The front desk staff was super helpful and friendly with every interaction. The hotel itself is in very good shape, with newish soft goods and just a few slightly dated fixtures. Our only real complaint was that our sliding glass door was "permanently closed" which prevented fresh air from coming in the room. The AC worked very well, though, and at least some of the other rooms had serviceable sliding glass doors.

ReviewText:The hotel was great just watch out for the parking charges and car rental. The charge me for the week instead of half a day. They need a new ball machine to play tennis with. The food was great but expensive. Your room was always kept clean. It was hard to store food in the fridge because they packed it up with tons of beverages you had to pay extra for if you drink or eat their snacks. Overall it was a great experience.

ReviewText:I was there in LA for business and decided to stay in WeHo this time instead of out in Manhattan or Hermosa beach areas. I couldn't have been happier with the location, amenities and service. -newline-  -newline- It was nice to be in a quiet neighborhood setting and the staff was friendly and responsive. -newline-  -newline- I'll definitely look to stay here again in the near future.
