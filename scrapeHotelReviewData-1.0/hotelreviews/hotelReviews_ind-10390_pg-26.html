ReviewText:The public areas are beautiful, the staff is friendly but it is way too noisy to get a goodnight sleep.  The room was big but the windows are single pane and I could hear the MTA buses putter up the hill on 5th Street.  Parking is $40 but I paid 13.20 across the street in Pershing Square.  I got a better nite sleep 2 weeks prior at a Motel 6 in Auburn, CA that was next to a freeway than at this prestigious and more expensive hotel.  It was quite disappointing.

ReviewText:The hotel is a historic landmark and absolutely beautiful so that was worth the experience alone.  The parking was $40 per day (ugh!) but you can use the Olive Street lot for $6.50 (weekends) a day! The maid also left a different set of towels everyday and the TV was from the 90's!  The best thing about the room...the bed!!! Loved it!!!!!!!!!!

ReviewText:The MB made our stay worthwhile.  The receptionist(s) were very helpful and took the time to recommend a few places to eat. -newline-  -newline- The hotel is close to the highway(s), sports arena(s), and arts district.  The weekends bring a large number of wedding ceremonies and the week days smaller conventions; in short there is always something going on around you. -newline-  -newline- Though the lobby, pool, and bar were all amazing, the rooms are showing there age.  If you are not planning on camping in your room your whole stay then the BM is an excellent choice.  Parking is a downer; be sure to to take advantage of the local parking decks if you plan on parking your car for several days.  If you plan on being in and out you may need to suck it up and pay for the valet; as you are not charged for re-entry.

ReviewText:Worth the visit as the common areas are gorgeous and decadently ornate. Nice bar with nice bartender who actually took pleasure in mixing a cocktail (old fashion, brandy alexander) Stuffy desk crew but air of first class expected. Pool is classic art deco with exquisite tiles. History hall with photos of past glory. down side is parking is grossly expensive $40/day , but valets were very nice and attentive. We came to LA after 3 nights in Vegas at the Palazzo - so the the older, small rooms, tiny TV was "different" and sparse. But room was very clean and quiet and bed was comfortable.

ReviewText:Adult daughters and I off on 4 day vaca from NY. Parking garage across from hotel was cheaper for parking. First night we walked into hotel to find a filming going on- A Tribute to Nat King Cole. The next 2 days the filming of a scene from the TV show"Heroes".  How cool is that!!!  Asked for a larger corner room and was given that without any problems. Didn't realize it meant alot of traffic noise early in AM. I wanted to stay here for the historical and elegant beauty of this Grand Hotel.  It met all my expectations and more.(look for the corridor with all the photos taken of Hollywood Stars and Famous industry people).  Getting to all the tours and attractions was a simple on and off of the Freeway.  A GPS comes in so handy .  Parking was a breeze in downtown L.A.  Check out the Farmers market, Hollywood walk of Fame, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, We went to the Bonnie Hunt Show taping and we saw ourselves the next Monday on TV.  The IVY Restaurant was nothing special and very pricey.  The Tour of Hollywood by open Van was fun and informative. A short ride to Venice beach and Santa Monica Pier for an afternoon was great.   I thought L.A. was so much cleaner than the streets of NYC.  First time there and we all loved every minute of it!!!
