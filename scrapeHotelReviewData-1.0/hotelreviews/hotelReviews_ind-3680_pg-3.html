ReviewText:No restaurant to have a small sit down meal. Although you are able to sit in the bar and order appetizers and sandwiches with your drink which is not bad. -newline-  -newline- The bar staff was great. Quick to respond and polite. -newline-  -newline- All other staff members were polite as well.

ReviewText:Spent six nights at the Hilton Pasadena. Rooms are comfortable but dated faux-edwardian and clash with the equally dated "dot com era" lobby. Paint was peeling in big chips, dangling over my head from the bathroom ceiling. I could tell every color the room had ever been. -newline-  -newline- Bathroom is miniscule with door clearance about two inches from toilet. Air conditioner was LOUD. Bed was comfortable with good linens. Bar ambience is a little airport-y but a decent value with good service. -newline-  -newline- Staff was the high point, friendly and helpful (including room service guy who made sure to point out tip was included in bill, something you never see, and a housekeeper who jogged down the hall to see if I was ready to have my room cleaned, and server in bar who fed me about twenty pounds of snack mix) but parking staff was a little off (outside vendor, though, I think). -newline-  -newline- Hilton Pasadena will nickle-and-dime you for parking ($25 per day in PASADENA?) and so-called high-speed wireless ($10 per day), pretty pathetic for a "business hotel." Room service rates fairly reasonable, food there and in the bar pretty decent. Didn't try restaurant proper. Paid $139 per night for king room ($175 with parking and internet), before tax etc. -newline-  -newline- Overall not bad but will stay somewhere else next time I am in the City of Roses.

ReviewText:We booked this hotel as a cheaper alternative to attend a wedding reception held at the Westin. The hotels are somewhat deceptively far apart, which was unfortunate because it required a car which for us was $15 per 24 hour period just to park. -newline-  -newline- They charged $10 for Wifi which was decently fast. But there was no microwave, nor fridge in our room (maybe it was locked behind a cabinet we couldn't open?). The TV had several HD channels, which was really the only positive. Everything else was very average and ho-hum, and I felt ripped off by all the nickel and dime-ng I went through when I could've gotten those amenities for free at a cheaper MOTEL. -newline-  -newline- Oh, one last positive I just remembered: 20 oz sodas were only $1.50 from the vending machine. Yay. -newline-  -newline- I won't be coming back to this Hilton anytime soon. For the price it doesn't really do anything to outshine the experience I'd have gotten at a motel.

ReviewText:I WILL NEVER, EVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN (OR ANY OTHER HILTON HOTELS). THEY CHARGED ME FOR FOUR MOVIES I DID NOT WATCH AND USE OF NINTENDO IN THE ROOM, WHICH I HAVE NEVER PLAYED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. WHEN I COMPLAINED THAT I WAS BEING CHARGED FOR SERVICES I DID NOT ORDER, THE FRONT OFFICE STAFF CALLED ME A LIAR AND WAS HOSTILE TO ME. I COMPLAINED TO MANAGEMENT AND DID NOT RECEIVE A STISFACTORY ANSWER. I AM A FREQUNET BUSINESS TRAVELER AND HAVE NEVER RECEIVED SUCH TREATMENT, NOR WILL I EVER SUBJECT MYSELF TO STAYING AT THIS HOUSE OF HORRORS EVER AGAIN. I'D RATHER STAY AT A MOTEL SIX THAN THIS PLACE
