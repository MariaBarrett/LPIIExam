ReviewText:This was my second time staying here and not a great experience this time. 45 minute wait in line to check in at 11:30 pm then woken up at 5am with someone else's wakeup call. Overflow Parking was in a poorly lit lot and I did not feel safe. Clean, cheap and convenient but I don't think I will stay here again.

ReviewText:This hotel is old and out dated if your on a budget it's good has a club and restaurant on site, 2 parking lots one on each side of hotel $8 a day to park. Area is full of shops & stores & banks highway close by airport 5 mins away very close. Even tho I had no problems here I would never go back. It's more of a party hotel for guys vacation or girls vacation wouldn't bring kids here not a family hotel. This place has 24 hour security so red flag ! You know if they need to hire security to walk the grounds something ain't right.
