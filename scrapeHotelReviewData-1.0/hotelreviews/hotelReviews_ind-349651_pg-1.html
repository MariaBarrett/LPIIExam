ReviewText:Stayed overnight while on all girls trip to Vegas. We had the best time! This hotel is fabulous! Right across the street from LA Live where we had dinner and not too far from the metro that we took to see the Hollywood walk of fame. I would definitely stay here again.

ReviewText:I was staying the room at very top with king size bed. Spacewise and location is perfect cause I attended Conference at LACC. One thing sad to say the next door customers made big nise at midnight hitting wall and screaming. The staff should warn to them before I noticed to front desk. Except of that it's perfect to stay. Nice thing they grant my request so quick !! Next time I'm sure to stay this Hotel again.

ReviewText:Location near LA Live and all the other downtown attractions was perfect. Good value for the location and amenities.. Room was updated, clean and comfortable. Staff very friendly. Only complaint was that our room was on 3rd floor RIGHT above the bar (or club). Music was VERY loud.. As long as you avoid that end of the hallway a GREAT stay..

ReviewText:Wonderful the only problem I found was using the room mini fridge. If you used it for personal items there was a 50 dollar charge. Everything else was perfect

ReviewText:Great hotel for the price. Clean and safe recommend for a quick getaway. Good access to shops and restaurants. Just did not like the parking fee of $40/day.

ReviewText:If you want a really nice hotel that is central to LA Live and several other downtown venues, try Luxe City Center Hotel. The JW Marriott and Ritz Carlton prices were sky high. Luxe City Center was much more reasonable, yet still very luxurious and top notch on service. We have no complaints. It was a great stay with a beautiful modern room, high end linens and a rainshower shower head. Connectivity to the TV was great. We hooked up a laptop with an HDMI cable and watched our Slingbox remotely. I love the high tech nature of the easy connectivity for their large flat screen TV. We easily walked to LA Live for dinner and then to the Orpheum for a show. The cab ride back from the Orpheum was only $5.25 plus tip. Easy, fun night.
