ReviewText:The assigned accommodations in the West Tower were good for a one night stay due to the fact that the bathroom needed updating and noises from the adjacent court yard and traffic on Sepaulvada Blvd. which resounded in the court yard were sometimes bothersome. On the positive side the staff down from the front desk, shuttle service, and security personnel, to the room attendant were super and friendly with great customer relations.

ReviewText:Room clean and functional. A bit ragged around the edges (window tinting torn - very old windows). Bed is high quality. Hall carpets stained. Courtyard, lobby, restaurant - very good. We had two rooms and saved substantially compared to other options near LAX with Shuttle Service to Airport. ** ELEVATORS ARE 1 YEAR PAST DUE ON INSPECTION **, and are very clunky which makes one worry a bit. Overall, in same circumstances, would stay again.

ReviewText:I had to book at this hotel about 2.5 hours ahead of time before staying there, and when I got there it took them 25 minutes to track down my reservation! The last thing I wanted to do was wait at 1:20am for my hotel room. Regardless, the room was clean, the van service was prompt and fast, and it was a good last minute room.

ReviewText:Thiis hotel is great for an overnight stay to connect to flights at lax airport. There is a courtesy shuttle that runs every half hour or so. The rooms are comfortable even though decor is quite dated. Only downside queue for checking in was long...
