ReviewText:The Millennium Biltmore is regal in appearance, very ornate and historical.  However, the rooms are not well kept, exhibiting tread bare draperies, bedspreads, and shower curtains.  I would not stay here again until and unless the place receives a complete interior update.  Its best feature is its location downtown, which is convenient for business purposes.

ReviewText:The Millenium Biltmore was probably a very nice, grand hotel in the 20's. Today, however, it is very run down, the rooms are small and dingy, and there wasn't even a mini-bar in the room. That meant that if we wanted a bottle of water or a soda, we had to trek all over the (huge) hotel to find something.  The restaurants offered a broad selection of food, but it was over-priced and not that well prepared.       The location (Downtown Los Angeles) required that we drive everywhere, which took at least an hour no matter where we went, thanks to LA traffic.       I would NOT stay at this hotel again, it is a horrible value for the money and in a very inconvenient location.

ReviewText:The Biltmore Millinium Hotel was beautiful, however, very expensive.     We would have liked a larger bathroom and a moderately priced restaurant.

ReviewText:It was my first time in LA and was very pleased with my visit.  My only complaint?was the mattress - it was not too comfortable.  Other then that, the Biltmore is a beautiful hotel.

ReviewText:I paid 10$ for the Internet everyday and I could never access wireless although they told me they had wireless.      The parking cost me 32$ a day and only valet parking is available which means probably you'd pay more for tips.

ReviewText:The Millenium Biltmore Hotel was not such as good experience than i hoped it would be. It seemed like that the staff did not know a lot about their job. That evening I asked the concierge if he could expain me how to get to a specific club, which he couldn't. Therefore I requested if he could look it up on the internet. Again, i would expect a concierge to do so without asking him.       The room was very small, and it seemed like it hasn't been renovated for a long time. I also could see dry blood on the carpet, which I thought was very ugly.      Room service was ok, thery brought the food pretty quickly and warm.       My friend paid for the room service and the parking $112, when we checked out. Unfortunalty at the next day we could see on her account statement, that the hotel has charged $460 instead of $112. I beieve that the front office agent should have noticed that they have charged too much at the end of her/his shift, which he/she hasn't. Therefore we had to call the hotel and sort things out. The worst of all is, that nobody felt responsible nor did anyone apologise for what happened.

ReviewText:I remember visiting the Biltmore as a child. Soaring ceilings, fountains, murals, fresh flowers in the lobby, gracious staff...It was convenient being located downtown near the City of the Angels Cathedral, Disney Concert Hall, MoMA and plenty of restaurants.       The hallways and common spaces are beautifully appointed and my room was lovely.       The only downside is that with the beautiful weather in Los Angeles there are no grounds, no tennis courts, no outdoor swimming pools or outdoor spaces to relax and have a drink.

ReviewText:The price of this hotel is great, but the location isn't good for tourists.  Also, the front desk workers were rude.   I think the front desk guy was just being a jerk.  Otherwise, it's a pretty good deal, but not a great location for tourists.
