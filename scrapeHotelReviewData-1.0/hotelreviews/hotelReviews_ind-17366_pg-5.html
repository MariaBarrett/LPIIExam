ReviewText:This is an older hotel, but the beds and bedding are really comfortable, there is a flat screen TV in the room, close to LAX, and a nice warm outdoor pool. I would stay here again if needed.

ReviewText:Pros: The hotel was very nice for the price we paid. The location was great - close to the highway, only about 10 minutes from Santa Monica (where we initially wanted to stay, but the hotels in the Santa Monica area were way too expensive), and a few miles away from LAX. Free wifi was nice. -newline-  -newline- Cons: Parking is $15/night. Walls are very thin - we could hear the couple next door talking at 7am.

ReviewText:Excellent hotel, amazing and incredible service, took care of everything I asked and even when they made a mistake, they didn't hesitate to fix it. Overall, I was very satisfied with my stay! They had sleep number beds and a great high pressure shower. Everything was very clean and the room service was delicious and quick. I would recommend this to anyone looking to stay in the area!

ReviewText:The room was a little dingy and very outdated. Paid $15 per day to park. I paid a little extra for the "executive level" room, and it definitely was NOT worth it. Although the step down could've been even worse I suppose. The good thing about the hotel is the location, very close to the 405.

ReviewText:Staff was friendly and competent, rooms were well-furnished and maintained, good exercise room and equipment, parking charge of $15 per night was a surprise but not unreasonable. Heated pool was operational but not the hot tub.

ReviewText:All windows in every room are sealed and can not be opened. Bathroom doesn't have any ventilation system and you will smell all your poop over night. They try to save some electricity costs by sealling all the windows. Air quility is horrible because you are breathing in several years old air trapped inside the building. -newline- The management is purely money oriented and don't care about customer health. Staffs were cold and not helpful. -newline- They also charge $15/day parking fee on top of the room charge. I would never stay in this hotel.

ReviewText:Very pleased with the quality of the hotel given the reasonable price. Easy access to everywhere. Keep in mind that there is a $10/day charge to park that is not included in the room rate. Room was large and comfortable. Staff was friendly and accomodating. There were repairs going on in room next door, but the workers were considerate and tried to get their work done while we were out for the day. Felt a little spoiled after staying at Best Westerns earlier in the trip. Would definately recommend to a friend and stay here again.
