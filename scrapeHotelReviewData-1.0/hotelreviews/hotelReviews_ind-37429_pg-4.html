ReviewText:The place was very clean. Lobby was attractive. Plenty of parking space was available, though it does cost 18 dollars a day to park in their lot. -newline-  -newline- The staff was friendly, the gift shop stayed open pretty late, 11:30pm was latest i tried going to it and it was open. -newline-  -newline- They have breakfast options for room service or you can get up and go to breakfast in their restaurant area. -newline-  -newline- This place is in a great location. Easy fast trips to many places, mall/restaurants.

ReviewText:Had conference there, staff was attentive and respectful of my needs. Restaurant and bar were too spendy, but roomservice food was ok. The location is great if you want to be close in to tourist attractions. Great shopping mall within walking distance. My wifey woulda loved it.

ReviewText:First of all, this is a good hotel. Very comfortable, clean and the people there are very nice. There are two things I do not like -newline-  -newline- (1) Location, the location is not very good. I have to drive additional 15 mins to everywhere, including San Diego and Disneyland. It is close to Universal Studio, but still takes 15-20 mins to arrive there -newline-  -newline- (2) Parking. Parking costs me 18$ a night. There parking fee calculation system is terrible. When you arrive, they give you a piece of paper and ask you to show it whenever you arrived or left. However, due to some technical problems, they gave me a new piece of paper every time I arrived, which is very annoying. Also, they assume you park every night if you arrived with a car. I happend to park elsewhere for one day, but they still charge 18$ until I pointed out. In sum, parking system sucks.

ReviewText:The room was clean, nice to look at, but the walls were thin. The hotel charges extra for everything...parking, wifi, breakfast, newspaper, bottled water ($5.95)

ReviewText:Great hotel, awesome location. Really I have no complaints. I was glad to see that there were no additional fees when I got there. A lot of times the hotels charge daily fees and things that are not included in your package when you initially book. I would probably go back if I was in the Burbank area again. Walking distance to the Americano mall which was really cool!

ReviewText:The Hotel was 5star.... the deal through Cheap tickets was great value, hotel and car. The only down fall was the daily parking rate which was forgotten about at time of booking our hotel and car package. Apart from that, it was a fantastic stay, nice and quiet. A room with a view would have been the icing. But I know that we can't have it all.... Great deal!
