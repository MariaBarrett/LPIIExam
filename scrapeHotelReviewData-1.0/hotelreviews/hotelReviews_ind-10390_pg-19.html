ReviewText:This hotel is absolutely amazing! Sumptuous and luxurious in a true Hollywood style, with a lot of old-school movie star memorabilia, chandeliers and dramatic staircases, marble and painted ceiling. That's the place where Clark Gable got his Oscar, for they used to hold Oscar ceremonies here in the old days.

ReviewText:Overall, it was a great experience. The only thing I did not like was the old style windows which let in a lot of street noise.

ReviewText:Hotel has been beautifully restored and has a long history in the area.  Staff was very friendly and provided a good experience.  Caught a 72 hour special rate which made the experience even better.  The hotel is located at the beginning of Wilshire Blvd. and close to Hollywood and Beverly Hills 10-12 miles, but 25 - 30 minutes travel time.  Great live music on Friday and Sat. night.

ReviewText:It was pretty cool.  THE ROOM SERVICE IS RIDICULOUS!  $30 FOR A CHICKEN SANDWICH?!  REALLY?!  SIXTY DOLLARS FOR A HALF A CHICKEN?!  IS THE CHICKEN DIPPED IN GOLD?!  UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.  AFTER I WENT TO RALPH'S DOWN THE STREET AND PURCHASED A WHOLE CHICKEN FOR FOUR DOLLARS THEY GAVE ME THE RUN AROUND ON WHO TO TALK TO TO GET A PLATE AND SILVER WARE TO EAT IT ON AND WITH BUT OTHER THAN THAT MY STAY WAS EXCELLENT.

ReviewText:The hotel was smack dab in the middle of downtown Los Angeles which makes it convenient to anywhere you want to be in downtown. -newline-  -newline- It is situated adjacent to the Historic Core if you are interested in discovering the way it was.  It is also next to the new downtown if more modern architecture is more your style. -newline-  -newline- It was great to explore the somewhat underground nightlife with many restaurants, theaters, bars, and clubs close by.

ReviewText:Everyone was super nice and helpful.  The bartenders in the downstairs bar, were not as friendly and actual ragged on the front desk people for giving us "wrong information".  Actually the front desk did not give us wrong information, we were upgraded to the fancy bar upstairs, and the bartender just didn't want us to go up there.  Humph!!!  Otherwise had a great time!

ReviewText:The MB is in a prime downtown location not only for business travelers, but for Staples, Nokia, etc. The staff, however, seems to be living in the past. I called the front desk in the morning specifically to ask about the availability of continental breakfast; i.e., toast-it-yourself bagels, etc. that are normally gratis at a hotel of this caliber. We were told that continental breakfast is served on G Floor between 7 and 10:30 am. We had a small breakfast - fruit, coffee, and a pastry. We were then presented with a bill for $40. This is not only not continental, but ridiculous.
