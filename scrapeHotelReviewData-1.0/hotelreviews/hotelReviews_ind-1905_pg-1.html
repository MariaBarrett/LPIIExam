ReviewText:Our stay at Hilton for 4 nights were nice. Although I think it was little overpriced. The location is great! Universal Studio is at walkable distance. I had to pay $28.00 per day for parking.

ReviewText:Great location free shuttle to and from the universal studio park 7 min walk back to hotel easy walk pool was heated but the other guests and me thought it wasn't, due to the water felt cold. Beds comfortable pillows too soft. Staff friendly. And ladies you will love the magnified vanity mirror in the bathroom

ReviewText:I have stayed at the Hilton Los Angeles/Universal City on my past two visits to LA & the greatness of the hotel is consistent. 200% the perfect spot to stay if you are visiting Los Angeles, California.

ReviewText:Obviously a great location, walking distance to Universal Studios. Didn't try the buffet but it looked/smelled fantastic, if pricey at $50 a person. They'll tell you to pay for wifi but it's free for HHonors members.

ReviewText:The hotel was clean, both the building and the grounds surrounding it. The location was good if your intent is to visit Universal Studios/Universal City Walk because it is an easy, short walk up the hill. However, overall it is an average, well-maintained property. I personally enjoy walking as much as possible and since it is located on a hill, it is not really conducive to doing a lot of walking. The elevators were slow and I always had to wait despite the fact that there were 5 that went to guestroom floors. I was warned by several other guests that one elevator in particular was "quirky" so I avoided even getting on that one. I did use the business center to check in ahead of time for my outbound flight and the computer & printer were responsive and they do have an onsite person to assist you if needed. There is no fees for use of the business center. The hotel is fairly close to freeway (101), so accessibility is fairly easy.

ReviewText:Spent 3 nights at the hotel and it was in an excellent location for universal studios just across the road. Staff were friendly and more than helpful I will definitely book it again when in los Angeles.

ReviewText:I reserved a King bed Room Non Smoking, for my Weeding Night and when we got to the Hotel the Lady at the Front Desk informed us that our Room had been given out and that she only had a smoking room. We had to take it because we were just to tired but I am not happy. My wife and I are current travelers and I do buy plane tickets from Cheap Tickets often, but now i will go else were. Thank you for a memorable (Not in a good way) Wedding night Cheap tickets!!! .,.,. The Lady at the front also told us that the Communication between the Hotel and Cheap tickets is not soo good.,., Never Again. .....
