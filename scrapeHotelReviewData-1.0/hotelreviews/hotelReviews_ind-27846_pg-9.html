ReviewText:I picked this hotel because it was between the Burbank Airport and the Thai Embassy.  My daughter and I needed two days for the Visa process and this was a great hotel choice.  Friendly staff, clean rooms and free parking.. My daughter discovered the great little shops in the area and that they stayed open late. We walked, shopped and ate (check out the cupcake bakery), safe and entertaining.. easy on and off the freeway.

ReviewText:Hotel was very nice, well kept with friendly staff and good services. The resturant was probably the weakest point of the hotel. While it was very convenient and the staff was attentive, the quality of food was only so-so. I'd recommend using some of the local resturants in the area, which are numerous.

ReviewText:Helpful staff and great pricing by [...] made this an ideal property for a weekend stay with the kids.  Near to Universal Studios and ither places to go in the Burbank area.  The village drive with all the fine eateries for all price ranges can be found within easy walking distance.
