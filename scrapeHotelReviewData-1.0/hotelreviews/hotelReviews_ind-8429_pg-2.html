ReviewText:My husband and I drove down from Big Bear for a night away from the kids. We picked this place because it was walking distance from the Sunset Strip. The staff was very helpful. The key entry to the floor with the guest rooms was very comforting security wise. The room was bi level, very clean and big with a fireplace and couch. The fashion was very 60's motif. The hallways were clean as well. They have a roof top bar and restaurant. They have free WiFi!!!!!! -newline- The cons; Parking is $38.00 self park or valet. The parking structure is very tight so if you have a big SUV like we did, it is kinda nerve wracking and tight. There is no ice machine, so you have to order it through room service with is $8.50 plus tip and it took 45 minutes to get to our room. I did write this down on the comments slip in our room and they gave us credit for the room service and parking. That was nice they cared. All in all I would recommend this place to anyone and would love to stay here again. -newline- P.S. Room would be suitable for our kids to come too. Couch makes into a bed!

ReviewText:We has a good expirience at this hotel. The valet service is a plus since you always retourn tired from the day activities. -newline- If you can't afford a stay un one of the great resorts down un Santa MÃ³nica with an ocean view, this is the best option to have a good location inside the city. -newline- You can walk to several coffees, restaurante and shopping. -newline- But for everything el de you'll need a car. -newline- The staff at the hotel is friendly and resourcefull.

ReviewText:Just a few blocks of Santa Monica Blvd, in a quiet residential neighborhood, you'll feel secluded but still so close to the WeHo action that you can easily and safely walk the 2-3 blocks to some of the coolest clubs. The rooms are very comfortable and stylish, very comfortable beds. Skip the costly valet if you have small car but beware - the parking garage is cramped, oddly laid out and difficult to maneuver around especially if you have a big car.

ReviewText:Booked hotel through this site....got there and right away, felt like I was getting eye rolls because I only tipped the valet a couple bucks, OK, its a 4 star hotel, my bad, -newline- I came to the front desk and told them I had booked through O (this review site doesnt let u type in travel booking websites names)....they said okay, but looked confused...apparently there was a record that it was booked through O but no record that it was prepaid (ummm what? arent all O packages prepaid?) -newline- so they said ok, they needed a credit card for incidentals. -newline- Next day, their is a charge for almost $1300 , $400 more than even my stay , and i immediately freaked out and they said it was just an authorization. -newline- WRONG. When I was leaving, the front desk guy said "oh you need to pay for three out of the four nights" (my boyfriend had already paid one night plus all the ridiculous parking charges etc....and i said no, you guys already charged me an "authorization" and it was a prepaid trip through O,....confused face again, and he said "okay youre all set then!" .....we left, and to my surprise later, that authorization went through, along with several other random out of nowhere charges (we are starting to think they are for the room service we made sure to pay cash for) -newline- They are either really really confused, or just love over charging people and hoping they dont notice. -newline- Staff even tried to charge me to mail something out....not an issue, but at every other 4 star hotel i have been to, mailing a simple letter has been a complimentary service. -newline- This has been a nightmare...never got a call back or even an apology, just a bunch of annoyed front desk people when i called asking for my money back. -newline- Sorry, I dont just have thousands upon thousands of dollars for them to play with... -newline- I am still in the middle of the dispute process...needless to say, total nightmare. -newline- It was a decent hotel...liked room sizes and location was random but quiet....but i just stayed in a three star hotel where the quality was the same and the staff was more well trained and actually extended me discounts rather than triple charging my card. -newline- If you want a luxury hotel in Weho/beverly hills...stay at the Avalon....or the roosevelt....my two favorite hotels, and the residence inn hotels r nice for 3 star, free buffet breakfast and the rooms still have a luxury feel. Roosevelt is my fave but the rooms r kinda small....Avalon has awesome staff, is pricey but rooms r perfect. -newline- Never had an experience like this and even though the rooftop tennis is cool and their small pool is decent enough, I will never be back. they seem to think their hotel is worth triple charging customers and then not even apologizing or offering something to make me come back as a customer (i would never, they might charge my card 3k for incidentals) -newline-  -newline- le parc is way better too , but its their sister hotel so my guess is they still hire people that are undertrained and watching the clock til they can go audition and try to get out of their min wage hotel job.

ReviewText:We were only there for one night, still we enjoyed our stay. The room was spotless, the concierge were friendly, not stuck up. Nice pool. The balcony, although small was nice as well as the fireplace. Good size room w sunk in sitting area. Laundry facilities were there, in the basement, and the location was just awesome

ReviewText:The location and room for the hotel were very nice, we were pleased. Pool was small but decent, no bar service though...would have been nice. -newline-  -newline- What really bothered me about the hotel is that they indicated they just recently completed a renovation. However, the lobby tables were chipped and old, the elevator had writing on it and we stayed on the second floor which had spackle on the walls and everything looked very unfinished. From the pictures on their website, I would have expected more. -newline-  -newline- Location is great though. Walking distance from Sunset Blvd and Beverly Hills.
