ReviewText:Prior to booking at this hotel I called to ensure they had conjoining rooms with 2 double beds each. I was told yes on the phone but upon arrival I was told they did not have this - only rooms with 1 King bed conjoined to a room with 2 double beds. I arrived at 3pm (which is the listed check in time) but rooms were not available until 4:45. Very disappointing!

ReviewText:We've stayed here twice because it's location to Hollywood and the normal tourist stuff is great. There is a mall and many restaurants around the corner so you can walk to dinner. The staff is very friendly and helpful.

ReviewText:The location of this hotel is excellent for down town Burbank, The hotel is in dire need of a refurb that was just commencing as I left, hopefully this will also be for the lifts and certain common areas that are most undesirable Once the refurbishment is complete I think it would be quite a pleasant place to stay

ReviewText:The whole set up was good. Great restaurants and bars a block away. Our only issue was a cork screw. It used to be almost every hotel had a cork screw in the room. Went to ask bartender for one. It was one of those plastic cheap ones with Holiday Inn on it with phone number...obviously for advertisement. Said I had to bring it back, they are $1.00 at most liquor stores. I offered to buy it. Nope have to bring it back...anyway, not a big deal just funny they don't give them away. My fault in the end for not bring one of the dozens and dozens we have from past excursions. I would go back again for sure.

ReviewText:Stayed here because of it's location to the Superior Court on Olive. The room accommodations and the business center availability reduced that stress factor which in turn contributed to our success in court. -newline- I would give the hotel high marks as a good place to stay during high pressure or stressed business situations.

ReviewText:I thought this hotel would be a nice stay since we saw that the hotel received three stars but we were so wrong. The front desk employees were rude and not friendly at all. The hotel surroundings were old and stale. During our stay, it rained the whole time so there were buckets around the hotel for the leaks. The leaks were mainly in the elevators which smelled like mildew. Also the visitors left trash outside of their hotel doors which took days for someone to pick up. Overall we did NOT have a wonderful experience at Holiday Inn. Thanks
