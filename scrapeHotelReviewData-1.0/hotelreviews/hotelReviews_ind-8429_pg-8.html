ReviewText:I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my wife when we went to LA to visit my sister and friends.  The hotel is in a nice quiet neighborhood that's very close to shopping on Melrose and Robertson Blvd and the bars on Sunset.  We had a car which you need if you're in LA and it was very easy to get to everywhere we wanted to go.  The staff was nice and we loved the fireplace in the room.  I also liked the fact that the room had a sofa and armchair.  Our first day in we were exhausted from the airport and rental car agency and after we checked into the hotel we asked a porter if there were any good places to eat (my wife is vegetarian).  He suggested a place 2 blocks away and we had a wonderful meal.  It was a great way to start our time in LA.  We would definitely stay here again.

ReviewText:Our first day, I was a little less satisfied with the demeanor of our check in staff.  I liked the layout, size and decor of the room, however, there was not enough ventilation in the bathroom/dressing area. Would have liked an in-room coffee pot (there was room on the counter in the kitchenette)and the parking fees were on the high side with no alternative street parkign.  Also, our room was above the entry door into the hotel and it was very noisy at night.  I had to put on the air conditioner to drown out the noise. Loved the cookies that were provided on our last night. I liked the larger than normal bathroom with a separate counter and mirror in the dressing area. Also, enjoyed the slippers that were provided along with the robe. Had to ask for a suitcase stand. This should be standard in the room. Loved the view from top of hotel of city and the pool and tennis courts atop the hotel. Liked the proximity to clubs, shops and restaurants from hotel.

ReviewText:The hotel was very comfortable, clean, cozy, and was in a great location.  Hotel staff was very accomodating.  The free internet service was temporarily down and they allowed their guests to use their computer.        The hotel is located in a residential areas right up the block from Sunset Blvd. that has many different bars, restaurants, and shopping. I was very impressed with the condition of the hotel and I would definately book another stay there.

ReviewText:The A/C was off and it took hours to cool the room. I told them in the future to keep the A/C on the day of arrival. The hotel internally is chopped up looking and  the elevator not working on our last visit is still not working. The pool is great and the staff do everything they can to help. Location is convenient and the price is better than most area hotels.

ReviewText:We enjoyed our week-long stay at The Montrose Suites Hotel in West Hollywood. The facilities are nicely decorated and perfectly maintained. Right from the beginning, the reception staff were very friendly and efficient. Although there was a misunderstanding with our reservation, as far as the lenghth of our stay, they solved the problem without even bothering us with questions or calls. The suites are tastefully appointed. The welcome-fruit basket and bottled-water are a nice detail. The mini-bar has much more to offer than your average mini-bar. Housekeeping was nothing less than perfect. The location, is perfect to visit and discover LA.    The only (minor) inconvenience was the tub/shower drain, which did not work properly. Other than that, this hotel and its staff was an overall great experience!

ReviewText:Vi bodde i ett lugnt område och var ändå på gångavstånd till bra resturanger och vill man ta längre promenad så går det att flanera till Hollywood blvd. Bussen nr2 var billig att ta och lätt att hitta. Vi bodde på hotellet i nio nätter och åt vår frukost på rummet. Det som saknades var allt i köket, typ bestick.

ReviewText:Mukavat huoneet, siistit ja erittäin viihtyisät. Myös hotellin yleiset tilat hyvätasoiset. Puutteena voisi ainoastaan mainita huono äänieristys naapurihuoneisiin ja käytävälle, tv:n äänet ja puhe kuului läpi.
