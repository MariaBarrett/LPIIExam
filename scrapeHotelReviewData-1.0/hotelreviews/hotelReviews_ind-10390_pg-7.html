ReviewText:This is an amazing hotel. Rich history, elegant rooms and a prime location make this the place to stay in downtown LA. I would recommend getting a club room as there are lots of extra perks!

ReviewText:Loved the overall ideal of the Biltmore but the room was tired, small bath - needed updating and some maintenance. Some street noise as well but overall a good impression. Staff was friendly

ReviewText:The public spaces are classic "Los Angeles 1930's". If you enjoy that kind of nostalgia, the place is beautiful. Unfortunately, once you get to the room the charm fades. The housekeeping was very poor -- long dark hairs on the floor, in the bathtub and sink. Whether they came from the last guest or the housekeeping staff, they were disgusting. And for a standard room rate, I got a room overlooking nothing but an air shaft with noisy mechanical equipment at the bottom of it. The noise was so bad I had to go out and buy earplugs to be able to sleep at night. Overall, for the same amount of money you can find an LA hotel that is more comfortable and a better value.

ReviewText:A friend and I stayed at the Millennium Biltmore for 2 nights and we really enjoyed our stay. The room was nice and clean and comfortable. The staff was pleasant. Everything was very clean and organized. The location was a bit far away from all the places we were sightseeing and visiting but all in all it was a really good choice and we got a great price!

ReviewText:Very tidy hotel. Very traditional. Some rooms have a closet safe some do not. Interior rooms - you do have to spend the entire time listening to aircondition units. Since i did not spend time during day inside, no problem. If that would bother you at night request outside with sun. My room was great for my needs.
