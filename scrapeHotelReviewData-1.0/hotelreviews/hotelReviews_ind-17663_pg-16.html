ReviewText:I've stayed twice for a few days each time at this Best Western, and it is an incredible bargain and perfectly placed for someone who wants a home base close to highways. Sherman Oaks has a number of great affordable neighborhood restaurants, too. -newline-  -newline- The rooms are nothing fancy, but they are well maintained, and each room I've been in has enough soundproofing that I can't hear noise from the (loud) street out front or adjoining rooms or the parking lot. -newline-  -newline- On my last business trip, I needed to go to Studio City, Culver City, Pasadena, and Hollywood, and those were only 10 to 30 minutes away from this hotel. -newline-  -newline- My only complaint is that the in-room heating/air-conditioning controls are either on or off. During a summer trip, it was easy to get frozen; on this cold January, the "low heat" seemed unconnected with the temperature dial and I was blasted hot.

ReviewText:The parking lot was rather full - hard to find parking. Street noise. Good value overall. This was the second time we stayed here on this trip.

ReviewText:On a surface level the rooms are decent; nothing fantastic but adequate, especially for a short stay. A couple of things that lower my rating of room comfort: the shower was awful, felt like it was lightly sprinkling on me. I could not wash my hair because the water pressure was not sufficient enough to get the shampoo out! Also, my door had large gaps around it which made it very drafty at night. They could sure save some money if they invested in some decent weather stripping...probably enough to get better shower heads and then guests don't have to leave their heaters on all night. Staff was very nice and accommodating.
