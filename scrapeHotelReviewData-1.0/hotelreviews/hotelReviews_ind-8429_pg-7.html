ReviewText:I can't praise Le Montrose enough! -newline-  -newline- We were delighted with the location - less than five minutes from the heart of the Sunset Strip and walkable to much of West Hollywood, even as far as Robertson Boulevard and Melrose.  We did get a lot of attention because walking is just not done in LA but we found that we got to see the best of the area that way - cheaper and better than hiring a car to sit in crazy LA traffic.  The hotel reception will give you a map when you arrive and it is so useful! -newline-  -newline- The hotel itself is fantastic - the rooms well-appointed and spotless, courteous staff, great service (we used room service and the restaurant a lot) and a lovely pool area.  The pool is quite small but the rooftop location is beautiful and we never found it busy. -newline-  -newline- There is also a rooftop tennis court that we took full advantage of. -newline-  -newline- I would recommend this hotel for couples and friends rather than families perhaps, because of the quietly luxurious and quite formal ambience.  The hotel also attracts celebrities, as we found when we were there. -newline-  -newline- I wouldn't hesitate to return.

ReviewText:I spent little time at the hotel, but was able to have a comfortable business meeting in the lounge.  Did not use the pool or fitness center.  Very enjoyable stay

ReviewText:The hotel was beautiful and centrally located to the attractions we were interested in. My reservation was made for 3 people to include a queen size bed and sleeper sofa. The reservation was also made for handicap accessible. Upon arrival, we discovered the room did not include a sleeper sofa and when asked about a rollaway, the manager was argumenative. The room all together was not handicap accessible, either was the pool. -newline-  -newline- We will not stay at this hotel again. We do not recommend this hotel for those requesting handicap access.

ReviewText:The hotel is in a great location in LA, right in the middle of the action and yet is in a quiet street. The room was very large and comfortable, with all the amenities we needed. I would strongly recommend to a friend.

ReviewText:The hotel rooms were beautiful.  However, the service is HORRIBLE!!!  I had to call the front desk and guest services 4 times just to get a cup of tea (it took over an hour).  The hotel itself is not as big as the website makes it out to be. Be aware of the $30 parking per night you have to pay, also, this does not guarantee a parking spot.  In addition a $300 hold on your card for any thing you may incur or break in the room is also required.

ReviewText:We used this Hotel for the last night of our 10 day trip.  The hotel is just off the main strip so is nice and quite yet close to everything you want.  All the rooms are a very good size and well presented.  The small pool on the roof is the perfect place to relax with fantastic views across LA. -newline-  -newline- The exterior could do with a lick of paint but thats the only critism I can make. -newline-  -newline- The best way to sum it up is we wish we had stayed longer.

ReviewText:The room and hotel had character.  I will definitely look to stay at Le Montrose on my next trip.  The only thing I would change would be the lighting in the room including the bathroom.  It was not makeup friendly!

ReviewText:The hotel is situated on the edge of Beverly Hills.  There are a number of great restaurants within walking distance.  Rodeo drive is about a mile away, well within walking distance.  If you are a jogger, this is a great location with plenty of sidewalks and side streets.  I will definitely stay again.

ReviewText:If you are travelling to LA and want to break away from the standard high-rise boring hotel, try LeMontrose Suites.  Location was in a beautiful section of West Hollywood, easy for walking or a short cab ride to tons of food, drink and shopping options.  Room was beautiful and a good size.  Restaurant/Room Service food was excellent.  But nothing tops the rooftop pool and tennis court, which couldn't have been more fun.  It might be a bit of a splurge for some, but was well worth it.  We couldn't have had a better time.
