ReviewText:The hotel was great for my visit. Everyone was very friendly and helpful except for the girl who checked us in on the front desk. I wish I had taken her name and passed it in to management. She was rude and abrupt and did not make me feel welcome at all. All the other staff were very helpful and friendly. The pool was fabulous and they have a great gym. I was surprised to fine that I had to pay an additional $18.00 per night for parking though. I had not budgeted for this.

ReviewText:We spent three nights to attend performances at various venues in Los Angeles and Hollywood.  The Glendale location was central to our activities and access to restaurants, shopping, freeways was very convenient.  We've stayed at several downtown LA hotels in the past and enjoyed them very much.  But we think we'll return to Glendale to explore the surrounding communities in the future.  The hotel and staff were exceptional for the price.  Great bar and lounge at the top of the hotel; great breakfast buffet and 24 hour gym.

ReviewText:I went to the lounge on the 19th floor - Horizon's.  The outdoor patio areas would have been nicer if the staff made sure to add propane oil to the heaters.  There was no heat, so I could not sit outside; it was evening.  The room was nice, but there were no instructions regarding using the "snacks" refrigerator.  The water pressure in the shower was low, so the shower was not what I expected it to be.  The health club had the best equipment and hours of operation, 24/7,I have ever seen in a hotel -- fantastic!  The room service was fast and great.  All I had to do was call and ask for something and I got it very quickly.  I enjoyed my stay.

ReviewText:Unexpectedly, we were given a free upgrade to the executive floors. We had a large updated room. There was a minor error on our final bill, but they fixed it immediately. The location worked well for our needs with easy freeway access.  But the hotel was very quiet.
