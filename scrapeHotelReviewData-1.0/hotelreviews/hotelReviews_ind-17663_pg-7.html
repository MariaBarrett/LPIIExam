ReviewText:Their staff was very helpful. -newline-  -newline- When we first checked in there was an air conditioner problem. They worked into the night(not in our room) to fix successfully fix it. -newline-  -newline- Your site showed a free breakfast, which they don't offer. They honored it anyway.

ReviewText:We were hoping this would be closer to Burbank (it was about a 20 minute drive without traffic) but we enjoyed this hotel very much for our one night stay. The room was clean and the linens on the bed were great! Only wished we could've slept in! We had an early morning appointment in Burbank and wished the hotel offered a quick breakfast like many do (they claimed it was because of the Denny's next door, but we didn't have time for a sit down breakfast). There's a coffee maker and fridge in the room so you can plan ahead and bring a few things. We enjoyed the pool too. We stayed here because they were offering a promotional discount and overall happy with our brief stay.

ReviewText:We enjoyed our stay over there, the rooms were tidy and clean, the 2 guys at the frontdesk were so helpful particularly Mr.Wahid. -newline- It may need a little rennovatin including the doors of the bathrooms, and if there is any solution to the noise of the cars that would've been great.

ReviewText:We chose this hotel for our four-night stay because it was deeply discounted that week. The room was ok, but it's definitely not a "Best Western Plus" level (we had stayed at many BW hotels during our coast-to-coast drive earlier this year, so we can say that with confidence). In particular, not only there's no breakfast at this location: they've partnered with what seems, judging from Yelp reviews, to be one of the worst Denny's in the country.

ReviewText:When my family and I checked into the hotel we had to wait about 15 minutes to get our key because there was only one person working the desk. The hotel is on a very busy street and we could hear traffic noise all night. My thoughts were, wow, this was listed as a 3 star hotel, I can't believe it. I did not want to use the bathroom and the sink tiles were cracked so it gave the appearance that the bathroom had not been cleaned. The room just looked old and used, not really a place I would want to sleep in. My family and I go to LA often and I would not book this hotel again, especially for the price.
