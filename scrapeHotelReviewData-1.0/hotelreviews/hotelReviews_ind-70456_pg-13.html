ReviewText:The Roosevelt was great for taking in the LA scene. Only problem is the pool gets very crowded so need to get up early to get a lounge chair. Otherwise, rooms are great, hotel lobby is beautiful and the burgers at 25 degrees are fantastic - and it's open all night! and hotel is across the street from the Chinese Theater so can walk to at least one tourist attraction. The spicy tuna sushi roll at the Tropicana was delicious!

ReviewText:For the money our room was very small. We were on the 3rd floor and could hear the music from the lounge area below. Outside our room was the roof top with generator fans that we could also hear all night.  We mentioned this to the front desk but didn't get any response from the person on duty so we just bared with it. For the money we expected a quiet and larger room. The hotel is beautiful inside but very dark. Takes some getting used to. The location was very convenient however if you have a car parking is $26 per day and there is no parking near by.

ReviewText:The Hotel Roosevelt was very comfortable, the room, although standard size, was very cozy.  It had 2 queen size beds, a desk, 2 chairs.  The bathroom was small but but everything a person would need.  A closet for hanging clothes, an ironing board and iron.  The location was very good--it was within walking distance to a great outside mall, the Chinese Theater and Kodak Theater, next to Jimmy Kimmell Show taping, food shops and such.  Best to take San Diego (405) freeway north from the airport and exit La Cienega  continue traveling north until Sunset Blvd. turn right (east) turn right at In and Out Burger a couple miles down and there you are at a great valet parking.  The staff was great from the valet to the check in housekeeping and room service.  It was a great value.  The lobby is dark and ambient with a throwback of the old Hollywood days. I would definitely stay there again.  It was a very good value but a very nice hotel.

ReviewText:I stayed here because my daughter had a function at the Kodak.  Very much in the middle of all the Hollywood action.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating.  The Dakota steak house is highly touted and popular.  The smaller cafe, 25 Degrees I believe, was excellent for both breakfast and dinner.  The room was comfortable, but the bathroom was a bit small - no real room for makeup, hair dryer and flat iron.  The room did have 2 closets.  Very comfy beds.

ReviewText:Perfect location for attending movie premieres at Grauman's Chinese Theatre and exploring Hollywood Blvd. Hotel staff are friendly and accommodating, and housekeeping staff greet you by name (even fold your clothes for you if you've left them laying on the bed). Upon checking in I asked for a quiet room as I'm a light sleeper, and front desk kindly upgraded me to a Superior Queen room, which gives you about an extra six feet of space--would have hated to see how small the other rooms were. Several large celebrity type magazines are in the room (very nice). While the first night was mostly quiet, the next two were not--lots of private events are held on the first and second floors of the hotel and you not only only hear the loud music, but the floor was even vibrating one night. Beds are very comfortable, lots of pillows and a quilt. Bathroom is small, but adequate with thick towels. Ice is delivered in late-afternoon by housekeeping (nice touch). TV is old and needs to be replaced.   However, twice I asked that the showerhead and bathtub drain be fixed (shower needed new washer, water spraying all over tile, and the bathtub was draining very slowly). I left a note with the front desk and second time alerted them verbally and nothing was ever done.   Didn't find out until my last day that there are two laptops and a printer for guests' use on the other side of the check-in area (this is not in their hotel info binder in the rooms), so I didn't waste time reading my e-mail.  My friend was staying on the 12th floor in a suite, and she had a couple of bathrobes (however, her carpet was stained, as was mine, furniture fabric was fraying here and there, but she had two large flat-screen TVs). Both of us said that the hotel needs to replace carpets where stained and replace/reupholster furniture for the prices they are charging.   I would stay here again as the location is perfect and safe, hotel staff are friendly (even if you are not a VIP/celebrity--plenty of industry people staying at hotel).

ReviewText:Everything was good at this location, but I managed to miss my flight and I blame the hotel.  The clock in the room was one hour slow.  I understand that Housekeeping has a lot to do, but that should be a standard to check.  I checked out and got in the car and realized it was an hour later than had stated in the room.  I missed my flight and caused a burden on getting home.      Pretty poor for a hotel of high standards.

ReviewText:The location of the roosvelt hotel is excellent, right on the hollywood street, near the Kodark theater and Chinese theater. Room is clean, staff are nice, the only thing is that the bed is kinda too soft, which might make ur waist pain a little bit. Excellent swimming pool and fitting room, and a very nice bar there. Hotel rate is a little high, however, considering the location, it is understandable.

ReviewText:The location of this hotel can't be beat: right across from the Chinese Theater.  The crowd is young and vibrant, and it is not unusual to see celebs wandering around.  I was there on Emmy night, and saw a few winners come in to celebrate.     Food and drink are not a problem here: there are several bars and a couple restaurants.  One restaurant serves great breakfast, the bar by the pool has good lunches, but the other restaurant inside leaves a little to be desired.  There are two bars: one by the pool (with waitress service) and another very swanky library bar inside.   The lighting in all of the common areas was very dim, which made it hard to see the stairs sometimes.  Otherwise, the decor was great!   The pool area is fantastic: there's waitress service and someone comes around to bring you fresh towels.  In the evenings on the weekends there is a huge party with DJ around the pool which goes into the wee hours; so if you want to sleep on the weekend then don't get a pool facing room, but if you want to party then do get one!   The rooms were nice but had a few issues.  First, the bathroom was totally impractical, in that the lighting was bad, it was impossible to keep from soaking the floor while showering, and there was no place to put anything (toiletries, makeup, etc.).  The furniture was too big for the room, which meant I bumped my shins on the bed every time I went to the dresser.  And, I had to turn off the air conditioning because otherwise my room filled with cigarette smoke smell, even though I was on a no-smoking floor.
