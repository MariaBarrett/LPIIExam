ReviewText:The hotel is centrally located--makes driving to Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Venice, etc...very easy. -newline- Valet is convienent but pricey ($33/day).  The Valets are exceptional--friendly and reliable! the hotel lobby and outdoor grounds are spacious and lovely. The hotel has an incredible gym, but again there is a surcharge ($20/day)  Customer Service is lacking and inconsistant...Valet is exceptional but guest services needs improvement (conceirge could do better too.  Small talk is fine let's stay focused). -newline-  -newline- Example of customer service mishap: -newline- i heard a loud "drilling" sound coming from the room next door early one morning (6am) and called the front desk to inquire--is it the shower, pipes, etc?  There was no apology but lots of confusion. -newline- In the end, the noise went away 30 minutes later...did not hear back from the front desk?! -newline-  -newline- Overall--good hotel experience and very accessible for an L.A. vacation.

ReviewText:The staff was fantastic. The rooms were nice but not that well equipped. There were 3 very small drawers under the TV and 3 even smaller drawers in a night stand. There was a large closet, but only 7 or 8 hangers.  We had to leave a lot of things in our suitcases. There isn't a coffee pot in the room, you have to pay for one.  Parking is expensive $33/day for valet, $25/day or more to self park.

ReviewText:I thoroughly enjoyed my brief stay at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza.  I had business across the street at Creative Artists Agency, which made it extremely accomodating.  I particularly enjoyed dining al fresco @ the hotel restaurant Breeze's.  I will likely return on my next visit to LA.

ReviewText:I attended a 2-day conference and my husband and 3-year old daughter came along to make it a family vacation.  Conference facility is excellent. Great attentive details were well put together at every aspects of this hotel.  There are 2 computer stations for guests to do their on-line check in and print their boarding passes across from the concierge desk.  Check-in staff was quick and professional when I ask to leave keys for my husband who will arrive later as I will be in the conference.  They are also very friendly in letting us have an 2-hour late check out since the conference ends at 2pm. -newline-  -newline- The most impressive service was the housekeeping staff.  We asked for a crib for my daughter.  They got us a brand new crib but neither one of the staff know for sure how to assemble it.  When my husband jumps in to help set it up (since we are parents with a 3-year old so we know the ins and outs of the 'safety' feature of these cribs), they gave us a coupon for free breakfast buffet at the hotel for the next morning.  It was a very nice gesture. -newline-  -newline- Breakfast buffet was very nice and staff went above and beyond to make my daughter happy with her breakfast choices.  Since the buffet has EVERYTHING but pancake, the waiter has the chef specially made pancake for my 3-year old when she said she would like that for breakfast.  He didn't even charge us for it!  This is service we expect from 4-star hotel, but still impressive when it is done in such a professional courteous way.

ReviewText:The Hotel is in an excellent condition , the rooms are extraordinary , the bathrooms are well kept and have marmol counters, balconies are available in most rooms , the only problem is that the use of internet inside them is very expensive as well as the room service . The public areas are well designed , theres an array of restaurants , bars and exterior spaces to spend a good time. -newline-  -newline- The hotels staff is very kind and friendly . -newline-  -newline- The pool area is superb , it has a fairly large pool and a very relaxing hut tub. -newline-  -newline- A shopping mall is just a cross the street , beverly hills is 5 minutes away by taxi , sometimes the hop on hop off bus goes by the hotel . -newline-  -newline- Take a shared shuttle from tha airport , it will charge you 14 bucks instead of paying for a taxi that would cost you 60 dls.

ReviewText:A great location for someone like me who had gone on business. The rooms are very quiet and very comfortable beds (a very important fact for me). The staff is very friendly. The Hotel has all the amenities one looks for. Loved the computer in the lobby where I could easily check in for my flight and get my boarding pass printed out!
