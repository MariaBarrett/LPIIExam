ReviewText:Not bad for the price, the roof top.deck was a major plus. This is a dated old hotel that has been made "chic" with cheap plastic and gimmicky accessories. Definetly stay here is it is the cheapest hotel you can find in the area.

ReviewText:The Standard in downtown LA is a sleek hotel located just 2 blocks from a subway station. Giving you quick, cheap travel access to most of LA.

ReviewText:Attended a Real Estate convention this past week. I loved staying at the Standard. Mixed drink prices are off the wall but in line with other establishments. The staff was great. The food was very good and the location was super. Wish there was a shuttle service but cab fare was not bad. Would recommend to all.

ReviewText:Amenities was average, most of the stuff there were overpriced. -newline-  -newline- I was not happy about paying $35.00 for parking (Note: People will have to pay $35.00 a night for valet parking and you can have in and out privileges. BUT if you use another parking spot to park the car yourself, then you will have to pay $20.00 a night with NO in and out privileges SMH THAT'S CRAZY! -newline-  -newline- Had my 19yr old daughter with me. She could not go upstairs to see the swimming pool because she had to be 21 and over. I saw what the pool looked like on the website and did not read that someone had to be 21 and over to go to the pool at night.. That was another thing I was unhappy about! -newline-  -newline- The temp in the room was cold. Just know that the temp in the building will not succeed the temp outside. It will always be cooler in the room/building. That was another thing I wasn't happy about. -newline-  -newline- Felt better when I was changed to a room that was a little warmer. -newline-  -newline- I honestly would not stay at this hotel again. Too expensive and it is as if they only cater / care about people who like to party. I don't believe they care about people who have family that stay there as the rooms itself are made for "couples".

ReviewText:while this hotel has a superb location (close to symphony hall, theaters, subway stops, central market, city hall, etc) and its rooms are comfortable and spacious, it is a bit dated and most of all very noisy. it must be the place to congregate for those who love to party all night and do so in a very boisterous way. luckily the hotel security service is happy to intervene -newline- and make them aware of others on the premises. we likely shall not stay there again.

ReviewText:Nice chic hotel. Staff seems friendly but there were a few weird things. Before checking in I called about parking options. I was told that I could valet for 38 or self park in same lot for half as much. When I got to the lot I was told valet only. So I valeted begrudgingly because I knew my company expected me to self park. When I checked in, I again asked for self parking and was told it shouldnt be a problem. I asked them to call their lot attendant so I wouldnt be turned away a second time. Finally the lot attendant comes in and says since there are special events it is valet only. I was there monday to Thursday and the lot sat empty. Then on my final morning there was no bill under my door. I had to call to verify my balance then stand in line for 15 minutes to get a copy. There were several people who peeked out and saw the line but none came out to help. When I finally got my bill the person asked me how my stay was. I said great except a bill under the door would have been nice to avoid this. He replied curtly that the Standard doesnt do that. I replied that for business travelers it is key. And then he had the nerve to say we have lots of biz travelers. I will choose a property next time where they really do cater to biz travelers. I spend half the year on the road and the little things matter.
