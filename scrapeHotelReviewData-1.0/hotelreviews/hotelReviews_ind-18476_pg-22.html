ReviewText:Travelling for business, usually stay at value chains like Holiday Inn. This room was cleaned to the best of their ability, but it's age prevented real clean. Rough edges on old finishes and tilework make it a bit grungy feeling. -newline-  -newline- No blower in room, just central air, left it feeling a it warm and stuffy. No view at all, high windows. Fixtures and amenities just old. -newline-  -newline- A group of aging bikers rolled in to party and see LA. It was probably perfect for them. For my needs, no repeat performance will be scheduled.

ReviewText:The staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were average size, but just right. Only had one problem and that was with the a/c, but only because Cali was having a heat wave when I went. Nice location and easy to get in and out of the hotel. Parking was also easy in and out. Had a wonderful stay!

ReviewText:This hotel is very close to LAX and manhattan, hermosa, and redondo beaches. I was staying for 2 nights only and was able to get my business done and have some fun at the beach without wasting much time traveling.

ReviewText:The person at the front desk was NOT polite at all. There were two elevators and only one worked. Due to the amount of traffic using the elevators it took 10-15 minutes for it to arrive. On day of check out, the only elevator that was working was STUCK. Good thing I was able to take the stairs down 9 flights of stairs with luggage! Found out that the elevator that is not in use has been out of service for TWO YEARS!!!!! The staff when checking out was unpleasant also. Parking is away from the hotel.

ReviewText:it would be great if the hotel can have facilities for boiling hot water, like a small electric kettle in the room, which doesn't cost much. The staff was quite friendly. The lift was finally repaired which helped a lot. The location was good. I booked and paid for the hotel in advance, yet it required me to deposit an amount via my credit card...I just hope the hotel will refund this amount as it promised, to my credit card.

ReviewText:I got there and even know was a big line for check in went fast,$115+$8 for parking for just one night was a little to over charge if you go into the place and it feel like air condition was not working and it was the smell of a old building also the bathroom was not well clean,location is all it have.
