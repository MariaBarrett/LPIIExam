ReviewText:this hotel is not so good. Not so near the airport. We wait 40 mins for the hotel shuttle. It is very hard to find the room. They are slow to solve problems you meet.

ReviewText:One of the most comfortable hotel beds I've ever slept in!!! I loved the atmosphere of the hotel, the d√©cor, courtyards, and nooks. The staff was excellent, always very friendly and extremely helpful. The room was very nice, with a table to work at, lots of outlets to plug stuff into, and a refrigerator. Free wi-fi worked fine in the room. There was an iron, ironing board, and hair dryer but no coffee machine. There's a restaurant, coffee shop and bar right at the hotel and a large selection of stores and places to eat within easy walking distance. The free hotel shuttle is quick, runs frequently, and is easy to use. The hotel is within very short walking distance of several bus stops. I couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay for 4 days of business near LAX.

ReviewText:Location wise, it cannot get any better. Just a stone's throw away from El Segundo airport and what more... hotel shuttle comes and picks you up in a jiffy... Hotel is spacious and has a relaxed look and feel about it. IHOP and Starbucks are almost immediate neighbors. All positives except that I was surprised why they didn't think of providing coffee maker in the room. On the whole, I would definitely use the hotel again.

ReviewText:Despite the nearby traffic on the ground and in the air, my room was pleasant and quiet. The complimentary airport shuttle was great and the bellmen provided good information that helped me find my way around the area. The open air lounging gardens with fountains were beautiful and the elevators efficient and smooth. I would like to stay there again when I have time to enjoy its pool and gardens.

ReviewText:This is below average "hotel". Not clean and smell old. They also will charge you $8 per day for parking. -newline- The only good thing I could find is the Starbucks coffee a cross the street ;)
