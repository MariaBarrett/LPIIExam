ReviewText:Hotel itself has a very cool ambiance - almost too cool.  The staff seems to be composed of 20 something year old actor wannabes.  I often felt that I was inconveniencing them with any requests (probably wasting their time from which they could otherwise be self obsessing or discussing their latest head shots).  I had a pair of subscription sunglasses mysteriously disappear from the pool bar.  All my requests to please look in the lost and found were denied.  I was simply told that no sunglasses were found at that specific time or at that specific location.  This clearly would preclude the possibility of the sunglasses either being turned in at a different time or found at a different location.  As I have a strong disbelief that there is a market for stolen one year old prescription glasses, I am sure the glasses are still at the hotel (most likely in the lost and found) but the staff is otherwise too preoccupied to retrieve them.  Of course, the other possibility is that the hotel attracts unsavory visitors that would stoop to the level of stealing used prescription glasses.  Either way, I would have been better off staying someplace else where at which guests are appreciated and staff can take the time to accommodate them.  Hotel stay ended up costing me the price of having to replace the glasses; almost two times as much as the cost of my stay.

ReviewText:Excellent choice in the Hollywood, West Hollywood, Beverley Hills area. I selected the Roosevelt for it's location. Fact is most anything else is the same or much more money. The A/C is a little noisy if you are a light sleeper you will hear it come on many times in the night. The service is excellent and right at the top for places I've stayed. My only complaint is the cost to park my car equaled what it cost to rent, $30 per day/ night. Great stay overall and I would recommend it with Orbitz's deals.

ReviewText:The lobby, library bar, and main restaurant have a lovely old Hollywood decadence that is very attractive, given the hotel's location.  The proximity to various Hollywood tourist sites is excellent.  Unfortunately, parts of the hotel are periodically off limits to hotel guests, due to private functions, and that occurred frequently enough during our two day stay to prove quite irritating.  The pool experience is unique, more akin to performance art than sunning and swimming.  Being a hotel guest didn't seem to provide much advantage as far as getting seated around the pool, and the surcharge of $20/hotel guest for use of the pool area on Sunday afternoon seemed unreasonable.  The real blemish on the experience was the noisiness of the hotel at night.  There was a party being held in the room next to hours on one of the two nights we were there that went into the wee hours and made sleeping impossible.  By and large, the hotel appears to cater too, and be patronized by, a 20 something crowd, who mostly seemed very nice, but whose collective idea of having a good time was a little hectic for our more middle aged sensibilities.

ReviewText:Hotel was exactly what I expected. Has a great pool atmosphere, bar and staff were helpful and friendly. We originally planned this holiday without the kids but ended up bringing them. Not the best choice for kids but I would highly recommend it if the rascals are not coming along.

ReviewText:The hotel was fun and a good location for people not that familiar with LA, but the customer service was poor and I am really not one to complain.
