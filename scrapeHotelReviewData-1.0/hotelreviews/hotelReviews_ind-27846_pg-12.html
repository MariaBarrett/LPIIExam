ReviewText:The holiday inn burbank was very comfortable, I like the bed and its clean and comfortable bed sheet, the pilows were perfect. It is located in center of burbank, like center of small town, burbank shopping center is just few blocks away. It is also very near to hollywood, 6 miles away, just 10 minutes drive. It is much convenience since hotel also provide free parking.

ReviewText:This hotel provided a great stay, the staff was very helpful and great to deal with. But the location was the best part of this hotel, within a 15 min (Town) driving distance to many attractions...NBC & WB Studios, Hollywood, and Universal Studios. Free covered parking was another big plus.       I would highly recommend this hotel.

ReviewText:The Holiday Inn Burbank Media Center was a pleasant surprise.I booked what I thought was just a cheap hotel,but was shocked to see what a fabulous place it really was.The only thing bad I have to say is that I could not get room service after 10:pm.But thinking about it now,I could have gone to any of a dozen or so restaurants located on every and any street around the hotel.There is a nice place just across the street where they make their own beer that I would highly recommend.The hotel room was very good sized and I had a good view of the back side of the mountain that has the HOLLYWOOD sign on it from the 8th floor.I forgot to unpack my bag the first night.Thats OK,there was an iron and board in the room.Along with a fridge,a coffee maker,hair dryer,toiletries,free coffee and tea stuff.It was fantastic!The hotel was staff was courteous and friendly,very helpful.The 3 star rating does not do justice.Should probably be 4.Now talk about location.I mentioned the Hollywood sign,less than 30 minutes around the mountain.Disney Studios,NBC,CBS,Universal,just a few minutes away.Literally 2 or 3 miles.Thats it!Dodger Stadium,The Rose Bowl,10 or 15 minutes.Any thing you want to do is right there.And smack dab in the middle is the Holiday Inn Burbank Media Center.A great place to stay!

ReviewText:The staff at the Holiday Inn Burbank was very accomodating.  They tried try best to make our needs met.  For example, I had 2 rooms. One for me and my children and one for grandma.  Orginially, I wanted connected/adjacent rooms.  This could not be arranged. Although, the Holiday Inn staff did make sure that our rooms were on the same floor. Having grandma close to me and my children is a priority, when we travel.  Also, I throughly enjoyed that all Holiday Inn staff was friendly; from the Bellhop, registration desk, housekeeping staff and parking attendant.  It was a pleasure to hear good morning fromm all and receive that friendly smile each day and evening.

ReviewText:We were allowed to check in a few hours early, the room we were to have was not ready but they gave us a room that was. The room was large and roomy.      We had breakfast and dinner each day at their resturant during our stay. The service was friendly and fast. The quality of the food was great and quantity...usually more than you could eat.      There was a large mall within walking distance and many unique shops along the street leading to the mall.

ReviewText:The staff at the hotel was excellent. Very polite and quite helpful.  My only concern was the clutter from repairmen working throughout the hotel to improve the service.  Again I found the workmen polite and helpful. There was no disturbing noise. The dining room service was very professional and the food excellent. We stayed on the 19th floor, a minor inconvenience as the elevator only goes to the eighteenth floor.  This proved to be a plus however, as the access to the nineteenth floor was through an open air stairwell that provided wonderful day and night views of the city of Burbank and the surrounding valley as well as a wonderful breeze that was extremely refreshing. The hotel is not new and shows some signs of wear, but the presence of workmen obviously shows a dedication to remedying any inadequacies.
