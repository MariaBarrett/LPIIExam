ReviewText:Lovely to stay inLA and not need a car. Universal studios a 5 min walk away, and universal citywalk just by the studios, perfect for evening eating. Great choice to suit all. Metro just down the road to access all LA. And, if you feel like being lazy, the shuttle takes you everywhere. Hotel itself excellent. Food looked amazing, but we didn't try. Rooms fabulous with great views. Would def. stay again.

ReviewText:I love staying at the Hilton, this location was perfect, prctically inside the City Walk and Universal Studios Theme Park (walking distance if desired). Thw staff provided excellent service and the rooms were very clean. I always reccommend the Hilton to friends and family because the prices are reasonable and you get to experiance 5 star service.

ReviewText:I loved the food (I ordered room service six or seven times in four days! The buffet downstairs was also fabulous!), and the staff were all extremely considerate and professional. The room itself was clean and neat, but it felt way too stuffy (the windows did not open due to safety and building air pressure, and the air conditioner worked fine but all we had to breathe the whole time was recirculated air that was either too hot or too cold... I caught a cold!). The room also had safety and security notices posted all over it... on the back of the door, etc... I started to feel uncomfortable, I didn't think Hollywood was such a high-crime area that we all needed such a plethora of safety and security warnings everywhere. Made it a bit harder to relax. Overall nice place, though.

ReviewText:This was my first time traveling to Los Angelos and I really enjoyed my stay because of the Hilton. The service was fast and the staff was very friendly. The room was clean and if I needed anything they would have it up to my room in no time. I would recommend anyone who is thinking Bout stYing in the universal city area to stay here. They have a free shuttle that comes and goes every 10 mins from the hotel so you do not have to have a taxi. The only warning I have is to have a lot of money for food because their dinning menu is very expensive. Their breakfast buffet was $22. This definitely one of the best Hiltons I have stayed at.

ReviewText:Location excellent, 5 min walk to universal studios and city walk. -newline- BE AWARE though if you eat the hotel restaurant they will try a bleed you dry with tips.  They will leave off part of your order and then they will fix in attempt to make it look like the waiter is doing you a favor, this happened both mornings we were there and that was the last time we had breakfast there.  Better option is to walk 5 minutes to city walk, much better value and service. -newline-
