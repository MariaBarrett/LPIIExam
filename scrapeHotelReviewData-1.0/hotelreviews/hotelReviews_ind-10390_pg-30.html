ReviewText:The Millenium Biltmore is a step back into the guilded age of Hollywood, but has modern ammenities.  We especially enjoyed the luxurious and opulent architecture in the public areas and learning about the history of the hotel.  They used to hold the Oscars there!  Although not opulent, our room was large and the bed was comfortable.  We enjoyed the restaurant.  The food was excellent and the staff attentive.

ReviewText:The hotel itself was very majestic, we felt like we stepped into another world.  The most fun was all the filming going on around the hotel everyday.  We saw scenes from CSI:NY, a brand new feature film, Ugly Betty, and a commercial being shot all within two blocks of the hotel. Each day we wondered what we would see next. Also very convenient to the hotel, was the underground metro (many people do not realize that one exists).  We rode it directly to Hollywood, where we saw the Kodak theater, Grauman's Chinese Theater, the Hollywood walk of fame, shopping and lots of fun souvenier shops.

ReviewText:The Biltmore has a sort of old LA vibe in the new Downtown area, where there are new bars and restaurants opening, it seems. One person told me Downtown is getting kind of hip. Its quieter than staying on Sunset or in Hollywood, but close to the MOCA, the Metro and even Silver Lake isn't far. The hotel rooms aren't huge, but have some old details, crown molding, etc... All is very clean and quiet. The lobby is  kind of    incredible and enormous. Various ornate bars to have cocktail in, walls lined with old photographs of actors from the 30s and 40s at the beginning of the Academy Awards Ceremony era. The gym is suitable, yet small. The pool is indoor, but clean and well kept. Excellent restaurants right in the hotel, though they are somewhat pricey. Cheaper fare, and things like a Starbucks, are right down the street. Recommended for those that want to try something different than the usual Sunset strip stay.

ReviewText:I thought the hotel for the most part was a nice hotel to stay in for the location and convenience of travel into other regions of Los Angeles.  I did think that the parking was over-priced since there are no other options to park.  The bathroom in the room was extremely small and barely left enough room to open the door properly.  The pool and spa area was terribly out dated and needed some attention given to restoration of the jacuzzi, and dry sauna areas.

ReviewText:The hotel was very historic and beautiful.  We stayed in a jr. suite and had plenty of room.  The club lounge was very nice.  Appetizers were great and the conciege was wonderful.  She suggested a location for dinner, made reservations, and we were shocked when we received an appetizer from the concierge at dinner.           We celebrated our anniversary and loved the historic look of the building.  There isn't a variety of dining options in the hotel, however the bar downstairs did make very good mixed drinks.        The club lounge offered been and wine.  The staff in the lounge was quick to refill our beverage and clear any plates.  We were suprised in the morning to have hot eggs and bacon provided.      Overall, I would stay again.  I was pleased.

ReviewText:Since it is a piece of art and historic LA landmark, I thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. I choose not to eat, use the business center, nor park in the hotel becuase it is very, very expensive.     However, I would recommend this hotel to anyone because of its great location, and the building per se, complete in art deco.     There are many wonderful sites nearby which totally promote downtown Los Angeles, so it is very centrally located.  When I checked in on a Thursday afternoon I immediatey walked about 20 blocks checking out the entire nearby area and was quite impressed.  The evening was further interesting because there was a musical group playing in Pershing Park just behind the hotel gratis of the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Summer Concert Series.     The most ridiculous cost in the hotel was the rental of a computer in the business center to check one's e-mail at .49 per minute. This tells me major hotels in major cities strive to make money on every single amenity they offer.      Anyway, I loved the hotel.

ReviewText:The Biltmore is a beautiful old art deco hotel. takes you back in time to the glamor of Hollywood. Great resaurants and the staff and service is very good. The room itself however had lots of room for improvement. For one, the entire floor seemed to be smoking floor and our room smelled of old stale cigars and cigarettes. The cleanliness was not so wonderful either. The bathtub needed better cleaning and in the middle of the night a bug landed on me! We were also situated above the airconditioning for either the hotel or another building and that was very loud. But the Arcitecture is amazing! So incredible. This hotel would be wonderful with some updates and no more smoking!

ReviewText:My door key never worked the entire time I stayed there.  However, every time I was locked out of my room, a staff member promptly met me outside my room to open it for me.  Also, when I entered my room for the first time, my bathroom was flooded because of the toilet leaking.  Again, it was promptly attended to by the staff.  The people at the front desk were wonderful and very friendly.

ReviewText:The history here was excellent. Vintage hotel with ghosts of past movie acedemy awards. Very Luxurious and comfortable. I can fell the past in the pictures on the walls of actors who stayed there. Built in 1923 but the rooms were outstanding. I would do this again in a heart beat.

ReviewText:This historic hotel was absolutely beautiful!   The pool and spa were especially well maintained and beautifully decorated w/great guest amenities including lockers, private dressing rooms and showers, hairdryers, etc.    The rooms and closets very spacious. With so much room they could put a small refrigerator or microwave in the rooms. Tasteful and elegant old-style architecture inside and out.      I was disappointed to have to pay $10/day for internet service. Also, since they cater to the business traveler, & we were on a family vacation on a holiday midweek special, so there was no continental breakfast being served as they usually do.        Staff was great and very knowledgeable about the area and the history.  It's very close to a metro stop which makes it easy to get around practically all of the general LA area. We took it to Universal City and Hollywood and didn't have to worry about paying for parking or traffic. Great deal!
