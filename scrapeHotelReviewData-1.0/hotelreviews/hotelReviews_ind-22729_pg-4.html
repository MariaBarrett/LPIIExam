ReviewText:They need to inform us that they charge internet per item per day before we book the hotel. -newline- If we add the expense on internet and parking it is not cheap to book that hotel online at all......

ReviewText:We were on a romantic vacation, but the hotel seemed to be targeted more for business travelers in my opinion.

ReviewText:Very nice hotel lobby and semi-updated rooms.  Clean and comfortable.  The bathroom and TV was the only thing that was a little dated, but good overall.

ReviewText:Hotel met basic needs, was in town for the Rose Bowl and within easy walking distance to the train to Pasadena.  I heard some of the hotel is remodeled, but our room certainly wasn't, while it appeared there was new carpeting, nothing (including the TV) had been updated since about 1989.  I would only book here again if it was significantly cheaper than the Westin, Hilton, etc...

ReviewText:The reception staff was wonderful. They were very nice and willing to help. I talked to them for a few minutes about why I was here - I had an interview in the morning and an overnight flight afterwards. He let me have a late check-out at 3 pm, even though the check-out is at noon. That helped me out a lot. -newline-  -newline- The room itself was neat, but not very new. The room sheets looked a little dingy, and the carpet was worn. However, it sufficed. The bathroom was very clean and big. Try to get a double queen or a king-sized bed, the room will end up bigger that way. -newline-  -newline- The hotel has a shuttle that will drive you to anywhere you want within a 3 mile radius, it does go to the USC Health Science Campus. It is very convenient, especially when taxi prices are ridiculous. However, they only have 1 car for the entire hotel, so you will have to wait for service. I, personally, did not wait long - I only had to wait 15 minutes for the pick-up and the return trip. -newline-  -newline- Overall, a very nice hotel.
