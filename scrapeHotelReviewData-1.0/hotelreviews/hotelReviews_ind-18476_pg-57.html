ReviewText:I really enjoy the court yards an out door fireplace in the even was lovely and the sitting areas of the other court yards was so pleasant I went and sat out side and thought now this is what California is about the comforter and flowers and the breezy weather and sunshine and palm trees and clean lovely surroundings And all of this so close and near the airport who would of thought, Oh and the shampoo and lotions was a real treat good size and the cool thing about it was I could use the computers  in the lounge and didn?t have to wait for one there where about 6 or more for customer use.  I would continue to going back with out any hesitation very clean and comfortable room I had and very good light in the room which is sometime very tough  to fine good lighting to get make up in. The Hacienda Hotel,   I'll be back!

ReviewText:The Hacienda was full of charm and curb appeal.  I love the fountain-courtyard and the roomy lobby with overstuffed chairs and sofas. And if you need internet, there were several computers available for use, as well as, access in your room.  The room given to us was less than expected.  We had the corner room top floor and it seemed a bit cramped.  We arrived early and had to wait for the room to be cleaned (not a problem). Hotel staff cleaned it early for us.  My daughter enjoyed the adequate workout facility.  There was plenty of gated parking for a fee, but, I was confused on exactly the best route to get to it.  A shopping plaza, the airport, and  is located only a few blocks away. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at The Hacienda

ReviewText:First of all, they made my son and I move 4 times in one day, because we were told the room keys had to be changed on the week of thanksgving which we thought that was not very smart to do.       We ended up going back to the room where we moved from after three tries at three other rooms which didn't have a good internet connection, another room was very noisy and when we got to our last room the manager was wondering why we were asked to change rooms in the first place because that section of the rooms was not having the keys replaced. I went to bed at 1:00 a.m., going throught the husle and I had to get up early next day to go to work. I thought that was totally unnecessary. My son and I din't need any of this husle. Besides a day after staying at the hotel, we had to call for room service in the evening. The room was not cleaned up nor serviced at all. We had to call it in. This has been the worse hotel experience my family and I have ever experenced.

ReviewText:The Hacienda Hotel is one of the best values in hotels near the LAX.  And you don't sacrafice a beautiful facility.  The rooms are not brand new, but they are very pleasant and comfortable.  Any time I am in this area, I'm staying at the Hacienda.

ReviewText:Excellent food, clean rooms and friendly people, although the check in was slow as they didn't seem to care if you checked in or not. Was a small line waiting. But I have to recommend the food!

ReviewText:Apart from having to wait fifteen minutes while they found us a room, our stay was pleasant.  The room was clean and roomy and close to both the airport and the major beaches (maybe a 10 minute drive down the road).  Overall, for what we paid, I think we scored a good deal for location.  Nothing too fancy but clean and cumfy.
