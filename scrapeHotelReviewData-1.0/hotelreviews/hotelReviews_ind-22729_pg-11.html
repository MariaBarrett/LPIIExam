ReviewText:booked a handicap 'suite' and was shown to a five foot by twelve foot hole with a bed in it. furniture was missing handles, stains in carpet sheets and bedcovers. bathroom so small the door cannot be opened if a person is in the bathroom. definitely not a handicapped suite. was moved to another room on the 21st floor, and had a similar experience, except it was larger (not by much). fridge did not work, air conditioning on full blast from the moment we got in to the moment we left, and room never got below 88 degrees. very used furniture and bedding, stained towels and hairs in bathroom.  Charges $30 per night for valet where there is only 1 employee, and it takes about an hour and a half to have your car brought up.  Definitely opt for the self parking ( though even this is $24 per night). garden is beautiful, but almost always booked for a 'private party' so don't expect to actually walk around in it. overall? total waste of money. have had better service and rooms at the motel 6.

ReviewText:I can not beleive that for the price we paid for the hotel that breakfast was not a complimentary part of the package. the hotel was beautiful, but next time I will stay at the Wilshire or the Sheraton hotel because they do give the breakfast.

ReviewText:This was a fabulous hotel, especially considering the rate we got.  The rooms were spotless and very elegantly furnished and decorated.  The beds were the best part - feather beds, down comforter, and down pillows - the perfect end after a night on the town!  I would definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.

ReviewText:The hotel is very comfortable, and accessible to the Music Center and downtown LA.  Little Tokyo has its own attractions as well.

ReviewText:This was my second experience in Kyoto Grand and nothing in the overall accomodation disappointed me: room was confortable, 3rd floor restaurants are fantastic, the rooftop garden relaxing. Overall, for the price requested, I think Kyoto Grand was a perfect deal. -newline-  -newline- The flaw this year was Internet Connection: I brought with me 9 collegues in a business trip and working from the rooms was simply impossible. And this for 10 $ a day per computer (for 10 people for 8 days it's a lot of money, wasted because of the poor wireless connection). -newline-  -newline- Kyoto Grand should really address this issue, because even if I really like the hotel, its restaurants and its position in L.A., next year I'm going to move to another accomodation because of the poor bandwith experienced last week. We were there to work, we simply couldn't.

ReviewText:Rooms were clean, hotel was nice. We didnt check out all the restaurants or garden or anything. We just partied after new years and went back to sleep. The staff was friendly during check in and check out and were helpful. Parking was $25 for overnight, pretty expensive. There is an outdoor lot across the street for $10 over night, but there is no security, so park at your own risk. Clean hotel, but kinda pricey. One annoying though was the japanese drums that i heard in the morning around 10-11 AM. I was still sleeping and I could hear it from my room, so it was sorta annoying. Otherwise, great hotel.

ReviewText:The Kyoto hotel was very classy and professionally staffed. Requests were responded to promptly. The rooms were clean and have great views. Mine did. Restaurant dining was great. Fitness area good. The price was reasonable and I can't wait to return. I highly recommend this hotel. It is also centrally located with easy access to buses, train lines etc. Do not miss the beautiful gardens at this hotel.

ReviewText:Located in Little Tokyo with easy access to restaurants, shops and the Japanese American National Museum.   Close to Olvera Street and Chinatown.   Close to Disney Concert Hall, attended a Count Basie Orchestra concert.   Close to Downtown LA and the Staples Center.  Our son and daughter attended a Lakers game.   Easy access to freeway entrances.  Short trip to and from LAX.   Beautiful Japanese garden on the mezzanine level.   Staff was friendly, courteous and helpful.
