ReviewText:The staff was very courteous, friendly & helpful. Sincere! -newline- The room was spacious & the bed was so comfortable. Plus the business center made this a place I will consider coming back to since I was able to keep up with work back home.

ReviewText:We were in Burbank to meet family and had a wonderful time.  We stayed there to be close to the NBC studios, had tickets to see Jay Leno.  Great location.  Couldn't ask for anything better!

ReviewText:Very easy to reach, right off the freeway. The neigborhood is very nice,lots of shopping and restaraunts within a few blocks. -newline- Rooms were always very clean and staff was friendly and helpful. -newline- Downsides (to me anyway) - no fresh air in the rooms, I coulnd't open the windows at all. I was on the 15th floor, so this was probably by design :) -newline- I wish there were different room layouts. With things like a king and a double bed. We had two doubles and a double is just too small for my wife and I to share.

ReviewText:They have an amazingly helpful staff. They anticipated my needs and were great with problem solving... they helped me get my clothes cleaned, on a SUNDAY!!!! Does it get better than that without being Paris Hilton? The rooms were very clean and the food in the dining area was pretty good. Making my first trip to California a comfortable one.

ReviewText:Incredible and friendly staff-always felt like I was being treated like a VIP. I had no idea how convenient the location was. Right at the "heart" of downtown Burbank with shopping and food galore-all walking distance. Also, the free parking was a major bonus!
