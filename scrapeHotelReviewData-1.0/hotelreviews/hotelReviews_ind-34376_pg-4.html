ReviewText:$15/night parking fee took me by surprise.  Free wireless was nice though, and the hotel is right around the corner from Pasadena downtown.

ReviewText:Upon arrival my first impression was delight at the modern and attractive public areas. The staff is friendly and helpful displaying positive attitudes. The new dining room is beautiful but the breakfast choices were limited so we left the hotel for another breakfast spot down the street. The room was small, generic, and dated. Could easily have been at a less expensive brand hotel. Linens and toiletries were equally generic. Marriott should spend some money improving the guest rooms now that they have completed the public areas. Also, haven't had a shower with so little spray power since I was last in a third world country.

ReviewText:We selected this hotel because there are not many choices if one wants to be close to Old Town. [...] The tiny interior facing window looked out almost at eye level onto a roof strewn with cigarette butts and trash. On one side of our room was the vending machine room. Across the hall was the elevator. On the other side was an overlook to the main lobby. Needless to say it was loud. During the night we discovered the vending machine or ice machine was leaking and the carpet was soggy in one side of the bed. It must have leaked under the wall. We just got up and left as fast as possible the next morning. I didn't have the energy or the time to try to complain to the hotel. Even if all of the above hadn't happened, the hotel is just a bit shabby for the price.  I only didn't give this a single star because a Motel 6 type situation could be a bit worse.

ReviewText:I had noisy neighbors in a connecting room the first night, and the staff was expremely accomodating to my needs, moving me to a room across the hall with no adjoining room the next day.  The concierge even helped me move my belongings.

ReviewText:In town attending a conference.  Conference, shopping and dining were all within walking distance of the hotel.  Hotel parking was available on room level and was secure.  Staff was friendly and helpful. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet and all it had to offer.  Wished that there could have been a heated pool. I would pick this hotel again; hands down.
