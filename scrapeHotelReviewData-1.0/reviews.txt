Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2014-04-28	5	There is too much to say about this place, the staff was very nice (open doors, greeted us, etc), the housekeeping was impeccable and even accommodated us when we didn't leave the room until 4pm one day :) -newline- The only issue was a very small one, and they more than made up for it. When we arrived in the room, we noticed some sort of pastry on top of the mini-fridge, opened and partial eaten. We called to let them know that wasn't cool, they apologized profusely, came up to get rid of it, and when we came back from dinner we found a bottle of wine and fruit/cheese/cracker plate waiting for us to make up for the situation. That was the above and beyond expectations moment!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2014-04-22	5	Overall, I had an absolutely wonderful experience. Te staff was great, beautiful hotel, clean room, comfortable, and great view being higher up. -newline- My only issues was that housekeeping came back to my room about three times before noon on my check out date and parking is pretty expensive. That would be a deciding factor if I stay again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2014-04-11	3	I was a little disappointed with this hotel compared to Omni San Diego. It felt like it needed a major update. I could just see my grandparents staying there with the outdated d√©cor. The room was nice enough, but it was not nearly as nice and modern as the Omni SD. My only real complaint was you could hear all noise in the hallway a little too clearly... Very average overall.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2014-04-11	5	I was thoroughly astounded, so I feel I have to give props to the Omni Hotel. I honestly hadn't expected much because their weekend rate was a fraction of the price of the other downtown hotels, but the Omni truly delivered... -newline-  -newline- Here's How: #1 As soon as we checked in, Karen at the front desk wished me a happy birthday; #2 She scheduled a last minute mani/pedi for me, then proceeded to print out walking directions to the salon in Little Tokyo; #3 The room was comfy and had an awesome view of the Hollywood sign... not only did the bathroom have great lighting, which could be a bad thing depending on how you look at it, but it also had a beautiful shower and separate spacious tub; #4 When we stopped back at the room to shower, the staff was waiting for us so they could deliver a complimentary chilled bottle of champagne and a cheese plate for my b-day; #5 There are tons of markets, restaurants, etc in walking distance, if you can handle a 10% incline, plus a nice fountain/courtyard next to the building; #6 The cab stand was always loaded and ready to take our drunken party to wherever we were going; #7 There's an awesome restaurant and lounge in the hotel with outdoor seating and heating.... at night they even had a charming piano player/singer belting out hours of non-stop tunes for the eclectic happy and/or drunken patrons; #8 You can trust them with your GTR. Valet was easy and their team was super professional; #9 I forgot why I started making this list; #10 The front lobby is always stocked with ice cold fruit-infused waters for their guests... So plan on saving your water bottles and fill up!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2014-04-01	5	The hotel was comfortable, clean and quiet. Staffs are really nice, my flight has been delayed, I called them thy put me on the late check in list, and they work very efficiently. Even they don't have free wifi for Normal Guest, but you could go to their website to join the select guest for free, then you get 6M high speed free wifi. They also ask what kind of room do you like when you update your Select guest profile, such like what kind of pillow, clean room everyday or just when you call, and the location of your room( elevator or corner)	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2014-03-04	4	It was a lovely stay, bed was worth every penny and the staff always went an extra mile to help in any way they could. Noe restaurant has the best scallop dish, amazing food, the atmosphere needs improvement. The prices for mini fridge items, etc. has become standard and it is sad that this hotel follows that trend. Way too expensive. They also charge for wifi.

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2014-02-19	4	The Omni is a very nice hotel. Older, but very well kept. Not as new as other I have stayed at, but again very well maintained. The room was perfectly up to date. Price was excellent compared to similar hotels like the Marriot, which is where I last stayed. The Marriot was a bit nicer in that it is newer, but value wise, I'm happy I chose the Omni this time. Because of location the Omni would be an excellent choice if you are planning a visit to the Music Center.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2014-01-30	4	Stayed two nights while attending a conference in LA. It wasn't convenient to the Nokia Theater, but I had a good time exploring the nearby Disney Concert Hall and the Museum of Contemporary Art. -newline-  -newline- The hotel was quiet, in good shape and the interior finishes looked fairly current. The interior architectural design, however, is dated. -newline-  -newline- The bellman staff was fantastic and the front desk was very helpful..	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2014-01-21	4	I stayed for 3 nights with my two-and-a-half year old son. The staff was universally friendly and helpful, catering to our requests with apparent pleasure. The room was perfectly clean and very comfortable. At my request, the staff provided a crib; it was quite small but adequate. -newline-  -newline- Room service was fast and the food was delicious. We didn't visit any of the on-site restaurants or cafes. -newline-  -newline- My only concern with the room is that there was a very low window with no screen that my son could open (I parked the crib in front of it thereby forestalling the problem). -newline-  -newline- The pool is an outdoor pool, supposedly heated - but we found it to be too cold for a swim after sundown. There is no hot tub. The exercise room is well-appointed and wasn't busy while we were there. I would have liked to indulge in spa services, but couldn't do so with a toddler in tow. -newline-  -newline- The location is great for taking public transportation to attractions all over the city (e.g. the Zoo and the La Brea Tar Pits). It is, however, pretty weird if you're on foot: on one side of the hotel the street is on the first/ground level; on the other side it's on the third floor level. If you manage to find yourself below street level (easily done) you can wander about for quite a distance before figuring out where you ought to be. (Of course this isn't the fault of the hotel, just something to be prepared for if you visit.) -newline-  -newline- Also be aware that the financial district does keep standard business hours, so many local cafes might be closed on weekends and/or evenings.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2014-01-02	3	The hotel located in downtown LA which is far away from those landmarks and nice restaurants. It is more a business environment for those who goes there for business. If you want travel there, suggest not live in this hotel. They offer tour to those landmarks which is called Starline. It is good but the price is fairly high.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2013-10-15	4	I stayed once at this hotel and was completely satisfied, so booked again. Im meeting my son there. He comes in at 6am, myself 6 pm. When I called the hotel to ask a few questions including could he check in earlier, the response was "I can not help you, you booked through a 3rd party". Even when I asked how full the hotel was, I got the same response and I must say, NOT in a nice tone. Omni, get someone to take your calls. This rep will scare people away.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2013-02-08	3	The rooms are poorly designed. Not enough lighting, and no lights near the closet or dresser, which caused for some difficulty in selecting my clothes. -newline-  -newline- The bathroom is large enough but there is zero counter space for toiletries and no place to hang your towel near the shower. So I had a sopping wet experience out of the shower to the towel bar. -newline-  -newline- The closet bar came up to about .3 ft so that meant my dresses and long coat had to be draped over a chair. Not sure the thought behind that design. Besides, other than the hooks on the inside bathroom door, where the robes were smartly being advertised for purchase, there were no other hooks in the room. -newline-  -newline- Overall, the lobby is nice, but this hotel missed some basic, but important details that left me dissatisfied. -newline- And for the price....this experience really was annoying.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2012-12-21	1	Everything was OK but this guy at front desk (12/19/12 morning) telling me what to do with my credit card at the check-out. I spent almost 3,000 in LA on gifts and tours using my credit card, the same I used when checking-in when I realized I was close to my credit limit I went the night before leaving town to change the card on file just to be sure and do not get any fee for exceeding my credit line, I gave them my debit card and told them to please do not charge anything else to my credit card, not even the $40 dollars per day for parking. Next day when got the final invoice I realized they actually did charge my credit card in one of the two rooms. I went to front desk to fix the problem asking what should I do if the bank charges me for exceed the limit on my credit card and this "employee" instead of yes we made a mistake we will cancel the charge to you credit card and will charge your debit card and if there is any fee (usually $35) we will credit it back and sorry for the inconvenience... He started to raise his voice saying well, we charge only one of the rooms but it works in both ways you "should not leave a card without funds on file" obviously everybody on the line was listening, you may understand how I felt, I raised my voice too and he just typed something in the computer and with an arrogant tone said I just canceled the charges to one of the rooms, that will be "enough" to cover any fees from your bank...It was like he was giving me charity or something, I just left. REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Also, the room was great...it was a perfect size for 3 people, the view was awesome and it was so clean. The only complaint was with room service.

The staff are great, from the efficient and courteous bellhops to the professional front desk personnel. And if you join their club, you get free WiFi, which is a huge bonus. Location is great and within walking distance of wonderful restaurants and the burgeoning Downtown lounge scene. Only (minor) downside is the hike up the hill to the hotel from most of Downtown, but you can avoid it if you use escalators through California Plaza.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2012-01-30	4	Received a great online deal for this hotel in the heart of downtown L.A.. Great proximity to L.A. Live (Staples Center, Nokia Theater, entertainment, food, drinks, etc) and the hotel even offers complimentary car service there! One think to mention is you should be certain to reserve the car service early. There was a 45 minute wait when we requested service. Otherwise, the Omni Hotel is a very elegant hotel with superb staff and nicely maintained rooms. I would definitely stay there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2011-04-21	4	We were visiting Colburn School which was in the same plaza as the hotel in downtown.  The hotel is tastefully and beautifully and beautifully decorated. The room was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was the best part of the room with a separate shower. The hotel had the internet access but only with extra charge. The guests had to pay for every minimal use of equipment in the business center including internet service.  The only place you can get bottle of water or soda was at the small shop at a highly inflated price. Even a bottle of water in the bathroom had a tag of $6. -newline-  -newline- Omni was very comfortable to stay at but it was hard to take the extra costs of everything I became used to be included in the basic service in other hotels.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2010-12-27	4	Our little LA Christmas getaway got off to a shaky start. I'd booked a room at another hotel, the Kawada (oy vey) on another travel site. The Kawada was a complete disaster. I quickly whipped out the smartphone, pulled up [...]and booked another hotel a block away. Found The Omni. Vacation saved! The staff at the Omni is top notch. Now that I think about it, they were all on the young side. They were completely attentive, eager to please, a class act all the way. From the valet and room staff to the bell desk to the front desk, everyone greeted us with a smile and went the extra mile to make us happy. I can't say enough about the Omni employees.The room itself was spacious and clean. The carpeting and bathroom looked a bit lived-in and the TV was a slightly outdated 27" tube, but that's nitpicking.The $10/day wi-fi fees are waived when you sign up for the Omni rewards program, and serves up a speedy connection. Valet parking is a bit pricey, $30/day, which is probably typical for business traveler hotels - nobody complains about the parking rate when it's on the company dime. There are a couple of cheap public lots in the vicinity if you don't mind walking a block or so. When I got home, I noticed a mysterious $4-$5 charge on my bill. Not worth the time to complain, so I didn't bother, although I'm sure the Omni would have reversed the charge without incident.Overall, I'd give staff and service a 10, the room an 8, rates and fees a 7. I'd go back, and I'd recommend The Omni to anyone looking for a good room and great service. It's not the ultimate romantic luxury hotel, but perfect for a couple on a weekend getaway, or a demanding business traveler.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2010-09-28	4	This was my second stay at this hotel in the past two months. It truly is superior. Upon arrival, really great doormen earnestly greet you to assist. The spacious lobby is always sparkling clean and filled with flowers. Rooms are well appointed, super clean, and have a separate shower and bathtub. Great water pressure in shower, and hot water is truly hot. All staff are superior in every respect. Late night room service is reasonably priced, and dishes were excellent. Hotel restaurant menu needs to be expanded or updated although the shrimp and watermelon appetizers were very good. Hotel is walking distance to federal and state courthouses, and City Hall.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2010-09-07	4	We went to a couple of baseball games, sight seeing and general relaxation. The hotel and bar are top notch. The staff, especially at the front door and town car service we're as good as I have ever seene. The fitness room was as good as anywhere I have been in the past. I wished the pool was bigger, deeper and more accessable to sun in the late afternoon. Understandable with the location of the hotel though. I would have liked to see a washer and dryer for self use during the stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2010-05-23	2	First thing was I booked the room months before and specifically asked for a room on a high floor (12 or above)I e-mailed and called once before arrival stating the same. Sure enough I was put on the 5th floor. When I requested a room change I was denied without any concern at all. I had also signed up for gold service prior to the stay and was supposed to fet all these wonderful extras like complimentary water the night of the arrival, comp beverage service and newspaper in the morning. Didn't happen until I phoned about each item. We even asked for water the night before at the front desk and they said there wasn't any at that time except to purchase in the very small store.The next morning only when checking out was the front desk person appologetic about what had happened. Then when I went to get the car from valet they seemed to forget me until I had to request a second time for my car about 15 minutes later.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2010-04-20	5	I stayed for a long weekend, Saturday through Tuesday.  The staff is very friendly; the location is super quiet at night; Disney Hall and the Cathedral are a short walk; the food at the hotel is delicious; there's a patio outside with fire-pit tables, right in the middle of the LA skyline; the red line subway is one block away, so it's easy to get to Hollywood and back fast and cheap.

Omni Los Angeles Hotel at California Plaza		2010-03-18	2	First of all, this place is not toddler friendly. Every room in this high rise has a window that easily unlatches about 2-3 feet from the floor, and with no protective barrier whatsoever. A young child can easily climb through and fall. We weren't happy about this when we were given a room on the 8th floor with our very active 2 year-old curious about the street below. [...]Our rooms weren't cleaned one of the days, even though someone came in for evening turndown service. All in all, I've stayed in motels that have more class. Stay here if you must, but be prepared to be treated according to how much you pay. Also, be prepared to pay an insane amount for daily parking.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">251 South Olive Street, 251 South Olive Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2014-04-29	3	Welp! For starters I read a few reviews about the lack of cleanliness of the rooms. When we checked in our room that was the first thing we noticed the surprisingly clean and fresh smelling room. The house keepers were very nice although the lack of English they spoke. The amenities needs work!! OMG you have to pay for parking $8 a day; and no continental breakfast. What type of "3 star" hotel doesn't have continental breaky? Any who; the hotel is nice walls are thin, needs upgrading but other that; it's awesome for the price.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2014-04-22	4	I have stayed at this hotel twice now and have really enjoyed it. I really enjoy the d√©cor and environment of the hotel.The second time I stayed there, the room was very small, with a terrible view of hotel machinery and was located right near the stairwell which I did not like. However, my prior experience I had a big and comfortable room.

Hacienda Hotel		2014-04-15	3	I didn't really like my experience. I'm pregnant and my sense of smell is really sensitive. The room smelled like stale urine and the heater didn't work. Also, housekeeping didn't do a very good job and weren't friendly. When I called about the smell in the room, someone at the front desk said there was nothing they could do. We spoke to the manager at check out who apologized and told us to contact the website we purchased the hotel through, but I don't really see what that will do. All of the clothes I brought home now have that same stale urine smell, and I'm a little sad that I paid $250 for this experience. I won't be staying at that hotel again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-04-15	3	If you need to get back and forth to LAX, this is the place to stay! Not only is it close, but there's a free shuttle to get you there. Beyond that, there are numerous restaurants, a great grocery store, and a Starbucks right across the street. I found a nice nail salon less than a block away. -newline- However, if you need reliable internet service while you're at the hotel, you may find the connection at Hacienda problematic. I finally had to create a personal hotspot with my phone to use my laptop. Also, it was unseasonably cool while I was in LA, and I could not get the room heat to come on. I tried everything, but nothing ever warmed up that room. This may not seem like a problem to most people, but I'm from Florida, and the forty degree temps at night were pretty uncomfortable. -newline- So, this hotel is a nice, clean, comfortable hotel with no frills for the basic business traveler, but if you can't create your own hotspot for wifi, you may be upset.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-04-13	2	Could have been better for the price I paid. I wasn't looking for a high-end hotel but this one disappointed me from get go.

Hacienda Hotel		2014-04-06	1	It's better than sleeping on the streets, right? Maybe not. I think we would have a better experience if we slept in our car. -newline-  -newline- Beware of the cheap deals. The west wing is like the haunted hall from The Shinning or the forbidden wing from Beauty and the Beast. -newline-  -newline- We got a room with two twin beds and didn't know. The room had a warning sign saying that there's chemicals in the room that may cause cancer. There was a white large pill on the floor. The sheets smelled like bleach. To top it off, the toilet did not flush, so we had to scoop water from the sink to fill the toilet bowl. -newline-  -newline- Horrible Horrible Experience. -newline-  -newline- The great thing was that we were able to check out the next day, one day early... and Orbtiz refund for the night we didn't stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

There's a restaurant, coffee shop and bar right at the hotel and a large selection of stores and places to eat within easy walking distance. The free hotel shuttle is quick, runs frequently, and is easy to use. The hotel is within very short walking distance of several bus stops.

We accidentally walked by them as we returned late night), water pressure in shower really low, elevator was nostalgic of a 1970's closet, walls PAPER THIN!!! guests in adjacent room we're very "noisy". Will not return. Do not recommend this hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-02-11	4	Pretty good deal for 60 bucks. Room was nice, and clean. Pillows were hard though, and and a flat screen tv would be nice. Other than that I had no issues.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-02-10	1	It was really terrible. I arrived one hour earlier and the lady at the front desk said that my room was not clean yet. She asked if I would like to have another room (ready, clean, etc), same category, I said yes and... -newline- She gave me the worst room in the hotel (I don't think there is something worst). The odor was so horrible and when I realized my shoes were making noises when I walked it. The carpet was completely wet and it should had been like that for days because the smell was so so so horrible. I was really angry with this. -newline- They moved me to another but still the smell around was horrible. I really didn't like it	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-02-07	3	Rooms were older than I thought, but clean and quiet.

Hacienda Hotel		2014-02-07	3	I've stayed at the Hacienda many times. Their centralized healing and cooling, which means you only have control in your room once the heating or cooling is turned on, can be a problem. I nearly froze my posterior off in the fall before they turned the heat on and it was quite cold. -newline-  -newline- Overall, the reasonable rate and convenience to the airport - plus their shuttle, makes it the best choice for me when I travel to L.A.

Hacienda Hotel		2014-02-03	1	I do a good amount of traveling. This is not a 3 star hotel. The room was very unclean, to say the least. Location was fine and so was the staff. Overall an unpleasant experience. Very disappointing.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-02-02	2	The environment is not too good but it is convenient but the dinning though. The check in and out took too long.

Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-31	3	I travel to LA on business and the hotel is located really close to the LAX. Some of the facilities, especially hallways, elevators are pretty outdated. However the room inside is spacious and clean. Very old TV, limited channels. Some options to eat in the proximity but mainly fast food. Restaurant in the hotel is expensive and not so good.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-28	2	To be fair, I only booked this hotel because it was a decent price, and near where I was taking my test. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful when I arrived. Nice shuttle driver, friendly front desk staff. -newline-  -newline- My problem was mostly with the room. It smelled of urine and old cigarettes as soon as I opened the door. I asked housekeeping if she had any spray for the smell. She apologized, said many of the rooms had a smell so I didn't bother to ask for another room. The white comforter on the bed had stains so I immediately took it off. Later that night someone on the building was prank calling the guests trying to get their personal information *scary. I then received a wake up call (that I didn't order) at 4am. Terrible since I needed my rest for my test. -newline-  -newline- Again, lovely staff, but icky room.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-23	2	Not a good choice to stay if your have an 8 hour exam next day. the flights from LAX disturbed me all night and I could not get any sleep.

Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-19	2	We needed to be up at 0530 to catch a plane. We had a portable alarm clock but to make sure that we did not miss our flight, we called the front desk and asked for a wake up call at 0530. The alarm clock worked but the wake up call never came. When I mentioned this lapse to the front desk on leaving the hotel, the desk clerk seemed totally bored with my complaint (as if this happened all the time).	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-18	2	In our room the deadbolt did not work and the screen on the porch on the deck was not in place. Had fallen off and it was on the side. So we couldn't crack the window--and it was hot in the room. We did use a chain for the door. -newline- The front desk staff were very nice and the shuttle to the airport was on time.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-17	4	Great location for LAX, dingy interior to hotel but room was clean and comfortable.

Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-17	4	stayed here 21 nights. bed was a bit uncomfortable, but i did manage to overcome this with using the pillows to support my back. i would stay here again because i cant see much else out there that gives you so much for the price. pool was nice as well.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-15	1	Two exchanges of card keys that didn't work lead to an eventual room change. If you or your traveling companions have mobility issues and cannot negotiate stairs, be aware. When you exit the elevator, there are a few steps down to the main hallway. Upon entering the room, it was stuffy and the only way to cool things down was to open a large sliding glass door. There is no climate control in the rooms. The lights were on some sort of sensor, so if I stood on the side of the room opposite the door for longer than five minutes or so, the lights would shut off and I would have to cross the room to turn them back on. There were a pair of pink sandals at the head of the bed when I arrived. They were not mine. The bed was very stiff and noisy, though the linens were clean and adequate. The television was having color issues and the furnishings looked to be dorm-room cast-offs. The bathtub drain had to be held open in order to empty the tub, however, there were clean and plentiful towels as well as toiletries and a functioning hair dryer. The ONLY saving grace of my one-night stay was the desk staff (I believe his name was Jason). He was pleasant, efficient and apologetic. Had I not had a 5am flight the next day I would have asked for a refund and found other lodging.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-13	4	Pros: Very close to the airport. The staff was quite organized and helpful. The room was clean spacious.

Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-06	2	Hotel looks beautiful in the photos online. You walk into the lobby, and it still looks lovely. After getting our room and walking through the hallways, everything from the walls to the carpet looked dirty and dingy. The room itself was clean, but the squeaky floors from upstairs sounded right through the ceiling and woke us up throughout the night, as did the thin walls in between rooms. The shower couldn't make up it's mind weather it was boiling hot, or too cold. Parking there sucks too. In short, I'm never staying there again!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-04	3	My first encounter with the staff was horrible, the front desk lady was completely rude. I didn't appreciate her attitude not one bit. After politely expressing myself she changed the way she was servicing me. Other than that pretty cool place to stay. Just not for me. Great eateries surrounding the hotel. Good eats.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-02	3	Shuttle service from the airport to the hotel needs improvement. I was told its a 10-15 minute wait but it was more like a 45 minute wait. The shuttle doesn't stop at every shuttle pick up it passed by a couple time until I had to get to the middle of the street to waive it down. My reservation wasn't in their system until they called it in which added another 30 min wait.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2014-01-01	1	This hotel is overrated as it is old and run down. Definitely not a 3 stars-more like 1 star. -newline- 1) we switch 3 rooms in order to have a room with proper hot water to shower. The rooms are either too small can't even fit a roll out bed or no hot water at all or patio door do not open or bathroom door do not lock. -newline- 2) all 3 rooms have walls peeling or moldy edges bathroom. Our last room is the only one with proper bathtub (rest are shower or fall off tiles). Be prepare when the shower runs it comes out so little water, takes mins to get hot water so once you get water.. Be fast- don't expect to enjoy it as these are very old shower heads. -newline- 3) room card 4 out of 6 nights do not work, we have to walk far far down to lobby to get it re-program again and again. -newline- 4) do not drive,as it is $8/ night parking plus room card only selectively wants to open the gates. So you can get in and cannot get out or can't get in at all. -newline- 5) room service are best, they come knock your door at 530am.. Oops wrong room after. They wake everyone up. -newline- 6) front desk service staffs... Extremely in bad mood at all time. They promise to give a $10 discount to our room-well did not happen, supervisor only say it but no notes.. So the staff says to us, "you have so much problems, why don't you wait till our manager comes to work." So customers if you have issue, they want you to miss your flights or appointment and wait for their manager. She actually recommend us not to check out first and wait for manager to go to work in order to get the $10 discount they promise the night before, but they don't think of making any calls. So they can make the extra $10..we are too fed up with all the bs past few days to stay any longer. -newline- 7) mattresses double are extremely small.. Not good for 2 thin people also very squeaky. So do not move or your partner will be riding roller coaster all night or only sleep 1. Do not recommend for family. -newline- 8) this hotel is too cheap, still using old style TV full of streaks when it plays. -newline-  -newline- Will not come back ever ever again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2013-12-12	2	Stayed here for 2 nights. When I first got there, there was a long pube on the sink and there was a lot of "water" stains on the bathroom counter.

Hacienda Hotel		2013-12-04	3	Hotel is obviously an older hotel (creaky floors!) with few in room conveniences (no coffee or refrigerator mini bar) . Room was clean and bed was comfortable.

Also like the little diner that's right next to it (Currasco's). -newline-  -newline- I have two criticisms of the hotel. Both of which I only encountered on my second visit (november, west tower). -newline-  -newline- First, the room had a musky, moldy smell. I asked to be moved but other room had same problem. I turned on a/c to vent the room. Returned to a cold still smelly room. -newline-  -newline- Second, there was no heating. After turning on the a/c I needed to heat up the room. Called the desk. Was told its an old hotel, uses a central boiler, boiler takes 10 hours to heat up, and they haven't turned it on yet for the winter season. Requested blankets but they never came.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

I dont see why we have to go through big companies to book a hotel online. wish we could just go straight to the hotels website and still get a decent deal. No ice machine in my building, had to walk pretty far to get to one. dirty shower non slip thingy. didnt even want to use it but then i almost slipped so i had to! -newline- overall just an average hotel. people smoking right outside the door, and room service meal was not good at all, but they charged a bunch for that too!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2013-08-17	5	I needed an affordable place close to the airport to stay for a night. I was pleasantly surprised. The hotel is really nice and it has a shuttle that makes transportation from the hotel to the airport easy. The staff is incredible friendly.

Hacienda Hotel		2013-08-16	4	we where visiting relatives in the LA area, hotel was centrally located near the beach, shopping center, and restaurants that u could walk to.

Hacienda Hotel		2013-08-11	3	This hotel is very close to LAX but I never heard the planes. The hotel was built in stages, the older side has nice courtyards with fountains, the newer side is next to the pool, with better rooms. I stayed in the older side and the bed was comfortable. The pool is nice, and if you like to walk the town of El Segundo has coffee shops, restaurants and shops. Continue down the hill to the beach.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-08-09	3	The staff was unusual....young lady at the check in counter had a leather jacket on, and acted like it was a chore to answer any questions...... -newline- I left a wake up call for 5:45 and they called me at 4 AM in the morning.....they should have compensated me for that mistake....other than that, it was decent. I would pay a little more the next time for a better hotel though	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-07-29	1	This hotel is not worth it's rating. The room was located in another building, far from the front desk, the water in the shower/tub would not come on, and after 2 phone calls and a trip back to the desk we were finally able to use it. In addition we were charged $50 until they look at the room to make sure we didn't dirty it. Although we ran the air conditioning all night it was still not cool. And don't even think about eating in their restaurant.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-07-18	3	Good stay. Centrally located near food, mall and airport. A microwave an/ or a refrigerator could have improved stay.

Hacienda Hotel		2013-07-11	3	The architecture and decor suggest a nicer hotel than we actually got; the place is clearly old, but fine, and it has clearly been cleaned up well after seeing worse days. The room was fine, a little dingy but clean enough, and the location by the airport was spectacular for the price in L.A. -newline-  -newline- Really craved complimentary coffee, but there wasn't any in the room or the lobby. -newline-  -newline- However, the kindest courtesy of all was extended to us via a sign posted in the parking lot: "Vehicles with an alarm sounding for more than 5 minutes will immediately towed and impounded, no exceptions."	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2013-07-01	2	Great location because of it's proximity to LAX. But the hotel is VERY old and certainly not as nice as the pictures portray. Smokers congregate at the back door near the pool area, and the smoke fills the hallway. Certainly not fun to walk into as you step off the elevators. Carpets need replacing and the room smelled VERY musty. BUT, the bed was VERY comfortable and we got GREAT sleep for the night. Some of the shuttle drivers are VERY rude and short. Front desk staff were friendly.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2013-06-26	3	It had average accommodations and is within a couple miles from the airport, and close to restaurants and a grocery store. The location was perfect for what we needed. Their parking lot is wanting. The spots are very narrow. The night we stayed the hotel was booked and there wasn't any parking left. So they don't have enough spots to accommodate all their guests, and they charge for parking.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-06-24	3	My First visit was Great, The staff at the Hotel was very helpful and got my needs taking care of Great job,, But my Second visit was not a Great Experience and I'll till you why, When I Arrived to the Hotel to check in at the front Desk they thought that I had Canceled my Reservation and why would I be taking a flight to Los Angeles to a Hotel that I'm not going to stay at!! So about 10 minutes later they had found out that I did had Reservation at this Hotel, I know check outis about -newline- noon but why Did the front Desk had someone else had the same room key if I have not check out yet? The front Desk was Informed that I was not going to check out until 2:00pm and that was Excitable by the Hotel staff, I Feel so uncomfortable that something like a mix-up can happen like this!!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2013-06-19	1	I've stayed at the Hacienda before but only in the newer wing....this time I ended up in the West tower which was probably last updated during the Roosevelt administration. Overnight parking was an additional $8 and wasnt' convenient at all. -newline-  -newline- Location can't be beat the restaurant next door is very good. Airport shuttle was frequent so that's probably the good news about the Hacienda.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-06-18	4	For the money, this was a great place to stay near LAX. We used their airport shuttle service twice. The shuttle was on time, with courteous and helpful drivers. Our room, in the 5th floor tower, was comfortable and quiet......nothing fancy, but served our purpose well. We would recommend this hotel when you need accommodations close to LAX.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-06-16	2	The hotel is located in a central convenient location, nicely close proximity to the LAX airport. The hotel is clean but old. The size of the double-beds room is okay , but the bath room is very tiny small, and the bath vanity is very small. The ice bucket was put right above and very close to the toilet. Just when I was in a shower already, then found that there was no hair conditioner provided for the room. The room was provided with only 1 face towel, 1 hand towel and 2 bath towels, should be more. The room was smelling moldy. I had to open the window a little bit to get the air circulated. Now I know why other travel company grades it 2 stars only. I think it should be 2 stars.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-06-15	1	Staff could not find our prepaid reservation. Told us to wait - then disappeared into a back room - and then reappeared to wait on other customers. We had to again wait - staff not interested in locating our reservation. After a long delay, we did get rooms -- only to find they were dark, dreary, and very run down. The ceiling registers were extremely dirty - with dust hanging down. No amenities at all. No coffee in room or available in the lobby. A parking fee for parking lot a block from hotel. This is definitely NOT a 3 Star Hotel ! Our recommendations - find some other place to stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-06-13	1	I admit i chose this hotel based on location and price. Well, i got what I paid for, there is no doubt about that. -newline-  -newline- Staff: Rude and obnoxious. There was a prom being held on the night of our stay and i was told that there was no parking and I would have to "hunt" for it on the street. When I asked if she was kidding me, she didn't seem to have any empathy. No concern for the customer who booked the room, no concern for the 12 hour travel day. Nothing. Rude. They were glad to charge me for it, just in case I found parking but if I didn't find any, they'd remove it for me. -newline-  -newline- Hotel/Room: Stinks. There is a foul smell in the South Tower. I know the hotel is old, there could be some quaintness to it. Instead, it smells and is not clean. The bathroom had mold in the shower. I was disgusted and it made the the rudeness of the clerk add insult to injury. -newline-  -newline- The only positive I can think of: The wifi was free. -newline-  -newline- I will not book this hotel ever again and I don't recommend you do either.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-06-10	2	The hallways have a disgusting odor... like something they need to change the carpet or allow fresh air to come in. The bathroom was small, and all the appliances in their were old. the parking sucks you have to pay, its not on site and you have to use your hotel card each time you want to leave and enter the parking lot. Would not stay here ever again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-06-10	4	Room was clean and quiet. Only problem was the tv didn't have very good reception. Staff friendly and helpful.

Hacienda Hotel		2013-05-30	3	The hotel location is great. The lobby is also very nice. I enjoyed the views and the aesthetics. There are also nearby restaurants for convenience. The room was small, but clean. One issue I had is that the hotel only provided one set of towels even though the room was a double occupancy. I called the front desk for more towels, but housekeeping never showed. I even left a note in the bathroom, but to no avail. That is a first for me. Guest should also know that parking is eight dollars per day as of May 2013.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2013-05-17	3	We have stayed at the Hacienda Hotel several times before and it seems to be a hit or miss. This last visit seems to be the worst though. First, the guy at the front desk couldn't spell my name right. He printed the registration form twice and I just corrected my name by hand on the second form. Then he gave us an already occupied room. So, we went back to the front desk and the lady gave us Room 1336 which was exactly where the dumpster and construction was (we were in direct view of the construction crew). The main light was motion-sensored which turned off every few minutes and the wall lamp was broken. The sheets were crinkly like paper, but at least they were clean. Also, the construction crew started (jackhammering) at 6am which undertsandably angered another guest. The male guest swore and yelled at them, which made them postpone the work to 9am.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-05-13	3	I have been in Boston for five years, and for the first time was able to fly back home to LA for a one week vacation with my son. Before he was born, my husband and I lived and worked a few blocks from the Hacienda Hotel but had never been there. Also, the freeway entrance to the 105 is a few blocks away, and that is a launching pad to anywhere in LA. -newline-  -newline- Here's the scoop: -newline- - Location: perfect. Near the airport but not so close that airplane noise is a problem, so it's a very short time from baggage check to relaxing in your room. There is a Ralph's grocery store, Walgreen's pharmacy, and Starbucks across the street. Also across the street/within the block: about 7 different restaurant choices (Five Guys, El Pollo Loco, Carl's Jr, and much more. It's right next to two gas stations when you have to fill up your rental car. -newline-  -newline- - Room: honestly, it looks like the building has been there for 25+ years. It's a little run down (cracks in tile, a crazy old air conditioner/heater panel, etc). But it's CLEAN. We were in the South Tower, which is a bit of a walk from the lobby. Ask for a south facing room so you have a nicer view (view from the other side is laundry room and other hotel rooms). -newline-  -newline- - Beds: Clean, fluffy duvet and starchy linens. Pillows were fluffy. We slept just fine. -newline-  -newline- - Amenities in the room: just about none - no refrigerator (but no bugs either!), no-name shampoo, soap, and moisturizer. -newline-  -newline- - Windows: South Tower doors are about 6' high and open fully. There is a +/- 4' iron fixture that would not be easy to climb. Still, when we were in our first room facing north on the 5th floor, it worried me to have the door open with my 5 year old who loves to climb. -newline-  -newline- - Hotel amenities: has restaurant and bar on site, and that bar is BUSY. There is good night life at this hotel. There is a lovely area to the south of the South Tower that has a lush grassy area with the pool next to it. It's a paradise to hide away in for a while - a must visit. -newline-  -newline- - Airport Shuttle: leaves every 15 to 20 minutes to the airport, and same for pickup. The drivers often proactively inquired when they saw us if we needed a ride. -newline-  -newline- - Staff: Everyone was super friendly and helpful. The concierge saved our trip when we went looking for my son's loist turtle - the concierge had him on the mantel and gave him back to my son with a huge smile. -newline-  -newline- - Overall: if you want to stay in a 'nice' hotel, this is not the place for you. This is, however, absolutely the BEST hotel you will get at this price. You just can't beat this rate, everything else in this neighborhood is awful. If you're going to be going to Disney etc like us and not spend a lot of time there, then who needs luxury? We just wanted nice beds and friendly staff, and we got it. Also, the hotel's spanish themed grounds are nice. And there's little things like the cold water at the front door with orange or strawberry slices and containers of lollipops that we dropped by each day. -newline-  -newline- Highly recommended for cost-conscious travellers who want the ideal location - you can get most anything by walking one block!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-05-05	2	We've stayed at plenty hotels but this one was not clear nor did it look clean. It was too rustic and the halls were dingy looking.

Hacienda Hotel		2013-05-02	4	The staff was very accommodating. We arrived an hour before check in time, which wasn't a problem at all.

Hacienda Hotel		2013-04-13	3	Many niced things like common areas to spend time with our family, but pool closes at dusk and was not very clean. Rooms also not overly clean, but acceptable. No coffee, fridge or microwave in room. No a/c in the building! Nothing free in the morning (breakfast, coffee) Coffee cost $4 at the restaurant on site.

Hacienda Hotel		2013-03-14	1	Poor experience all round. One of the 2 elevators was taken "out of service" for a "major upgrade" (leaving 1 slow elevator covering 9 floors, UGLY!), the air-conditioning did not work (a call to maintenance said "it's heat only", despite our room being in the high 80s, and the hallway in the 60s... something's fishy). Our first room was not what we'd booked (small bed, and smelt of stale cigarette smoke). H/T to Cameron for sorting out that part, so at least we got the right bed - had we not, the wife and I would have been sleeping in separate areas of the room due to the oppressive heat in the 8th floor of the South Tower. Had to open the door to the outside, and deal with the noise of the highway to somewhat mitigate the heat, the rusty safety railing made me stay well away from looking out though! -newline-  -newline- Needless to say, not what we wanted after a red-eye flight from Fiji and a full day's air travel the next day. Avoid if you value your sanity. Our previous stay at La Quinta was much better for around the same spend (oh, and got free breakfast there too, not here!)	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2013-03-13	4	The hotel shuttle bus is available from LAX airport. -newline- There are many places such as restaurants, cafes, and supermarket near the hotel.

Hacienda Hotel		2013-03-09	3	Good hotel for what we needed- a night stay after coming off a late night flight. The hotel is just a bit old- for example, our tap in the bathroom sink had come away from sink but the staff were great and said they would fix it ASAP. But if you need just a night or more to make your travel to and from the airport easier its great. Plus free shuttle bus to and from the airport there are also lots of places to eat close by.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-11-15	5	Very close to the testing center, close to shops, and eateries!

Hacienda Hotel		2012-11-13	2	The Pro's -newline- -Only 5 minutes from the terminal -newline- -Free Shuttle -newline-  -newline- The Con's -newline- -Annex building is not up to bar with the rest of the facility -newline- -Staff originally issued me keys to a room that was already in use. -newline-  -newline- Other Thoughts -newline- -at night they only have 1 check in agent. I had to wait half an hour just to be checked in. -newline- -wifi is provided free, but the access key is not provided in their pamphlet, you must contact the front desk to get it. -newline-  -newline- Bottom line: For the price, I expect a great deal more out of a hotel than to be placed in a rickety annex building with elevators that give the impression that they will be giving out at any moment.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-11-08	3	Staff was not friendly nor helpful. Bathroom was dirty on check in. Positive restaurant and club on site so no need to go far.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-11-05	1	Check in was delayed due to the previous person had not checked out and we were not notified. Had to change rooms upon check in. The noise level during the a.m. hours were horriable. 3.a.m. noise from hall way, room next door and outside at the pool kept us up. I would not ever encourage anybody else to stay there. Very dissapointed.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-10-22	5	This hotel is beautiful--relaxing courtyards, clean and modern common areas, fun bar, yummy restaurant, and friendly staff. We could have remained in the hotel for our entire stay and had a relaxing weekend. Across the street there are a large selection of restaurants, a pharmacy, a grocery store, coffee shops--everything one might need. We were worried about the air traffic noise because it's only a half mile from the airport, but we didn't hear a thing. We will definitely stay there again!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-10-03	1	The lady at the front desk was very very rude. Maybe she was having a bad day, I don't know but she was very very unwelcoming. As soon as we got into our room we were hit with a strong hit wind of air that smelled like an old wet moldy carpet. We got only two towels in the bathroom- no hand towels or face towels. The bath tub was filthy! There were dark moldy slimy spots in the tub and only one soap, in a room that's supposed to be a double room. The floors made loud squeaky noises when you walk. The floor was so bad that it shook the entertainment stand- old stand with 24 inch tube television that turned on on its own. The ceiling had cracks and small leaks. The sheets were clean, I guess. I don't recommend this hotel, specially at 100/night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-09-21	2	Travelling for business, usually stay at value chains like Holiday Inn. This room was cleaned to the best of their ability, but it's age prevented real clean. Rough edges on old finishes and tilework make it a bit grungy feeling. -newline-  -newline- No blower in room, just central air, left it feeling a it warm and stuffy. No view at all, high windows. Fixtures and amenities just old. -newline-  -newline- A group of aging bikers rolled in to party and see LA. It was probably perfect for them. For my needs, no repeat performance will be scheduled.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-09-20	4	The staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were average size, but just right.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-08-25	2	The person at the front desk was NOT polite at all. There were two elevators and only one worked. Due to the amount of traffic using the elevators it took 10-15 minutes for it to arrive. On day of check out, the only elevator that was working was STUCK. Good thing I was able to take the stairs down 9 flights of stairs with luggage! Found out that the elevator that is not in use has been out of service for TWO YEARS!!!!! The staff when checking out was unpleasant also. Parking is away from the hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-08-25	3	it would be great if the hotel can have facilities for boiling hot water, like a small electric kettle in the room, which doesn't cost much. The staff was quite friendly. The lift was finally repaired which helped a lot. The location was good. I booked and paid for the hotel in advance, yet it required me to deposit an amount via my credit card...I just hope the hotel will refund this amount as it promised, to my credit card.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-08-23	3	I got there and even know was a big line for check in went fast,$115+$8 for parking for just one night was a little to over charge if you go into the place and it feel like air condition was not working and it was the smell of a old building also the bathroom was not well clean,location is all it have.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-08-07	4	The hotel is minutes from LAX and has more character than most airport hotels. Sunday night salsa night? What a bunch of unexpected fun.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-07-31	4	The hotel was fairly close to LAX and it has a free shuttle service which was great!! The bed was pretty uncomfortable and there was no in-room fridge which would have bothered me more if I was there for more than one night. The staff was really friendly and helpful, the resteraunt was pretty good, the bar was pretty good, and the overall style was worth the money for a near airport hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-07-29	3	We had a very short stay, but the beds were very comfy. The rooms are on the small side and the batherooms are very small, but the rooms were clean. The hotel is old and unique with 3 or so steps going up and down on the different floors. While unique, it is also difficult to carry luggage up and down. There is a great cafe attached to the hotel, as well as a barbeque restaurant. Close to LAX.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-07-26	4	Checked in late, enjoyed delicious dinner at hotel's Carrasco's restaurant. Recommend the hot red chili enchiladas, chicken Caesar salad and cup of soup for the day. Elevator worked great -parking was very secure off Holly St., needs hotel room card key to get in and out of. Classic window style& clean, warm southwestern decor. Felt like we were in a classic Californian movie.Water/heat pressure worked fine for our room was 8 stories up. We'd definately go back to stay. Convenient location to airport ! The telephone push buttons were kaput but could call outside just not to front desk. Clock radio/alarm worked just fine. Classic, wonderful and beautiful. Lobby really cool.Reminded me of my childhood days when my mother took me up to L.A. I'd go back in a heartbeat. Thanks, George. Do you know the way to San Jose? Nice folks, clean and relaxing Mediterranean style patios. Bring your dancing shoes for their bar has a big dance floor and watched couples doing the cha cha and such. A very fun place for sure.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-05-28	4	I was greeted with a professional smile and handed a clean room. I had a few meals at the restaurant, a drink at the bar, with food and staff well above average.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-05-23	2	If you are just looking for a quick stop before taking off or if you arrived late in the night at LAX,[ my case], then this is your place. I spend literally just the nights ( 2) not more thant ten hours, iin that hotel. But If you are looking just for a littel confort look for different place. I sleep ok almost on every surface but the bed and the pillos are not to confertable. for a comfortable two-night stay, try someone else. The bed was uncomfortable, the room was clean enough and the service was OK. $8 to park and there is free wifi.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-05-06	3	We basically wanted a place near LAX for an early AM flight for a fair price, and we were not disappointed. The bedding and bed were very comfortable.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-05-05	1	Honestly.... I hope I save you some time. This hotel is awful. Staff is bad.. Rooms are outdated. The parking is awful and our TV didnt even work.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-05-04	4	This place is a lovely old hotel, well-run, good front-desk staff and concierges, friendly shuttle-drivers...clean comfy rooms. It's only about 10 minutes from LAX by shuttle/car ~ close enough for efficiency but far enough not to hear the roars. Nice pool and gardens, gorgeous tiled courtyards with fountains. Right across the street from a very good 24-hour supermarket (Ralph's), a Walgreen's and a wide variety of eateries. I will definitely stay there when in LA and particularly when I need to be near LAX. This place is very good value for the money.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-05-02	4	It's an older hotel, but clean and well-kept.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-04-27	2	The hotel is in a fairly convenient location and is in fairly good condition, just a little worn around the edges. We found out at check in that we would be charged an additional $8 per day for parking, what they didn't tell us is their parking lots are constantly full! We came back at 11pm after our first full day and found the lot full with 4 or 5 other hapless guests driving around in circles! Ended up parking on the street where some dirtbag stole the valve stem caps off our rental car. Only other issue was the bathtub drain. Problem is it didn't.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-04-25	3	My husband left his billfold on the shuttle and your driver took the extra effort to bring it to the airport and even offered me his cell phone to locate my husband as he was headed back to the hotel.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-04-18	2	Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. It is pretty close to the airport w/a 24hr shuttle to/from so that is super convenient. -newline- The hotel itself was lacking. They were painting parts of it when I arrived which will help but other areas, my room especially were not up to my standard. -newline- Upon first glance the room looked spiffy but as I settled in, I noticed things that should be taken care of... The paint by the windows was bubbled and peeling; there was a crack in the ceiling by the window; the window had been covered with some kind of film (probably to help keep the room cool) but it was bubbled and peeling. -newline- The thermostat did not give you an option of heat or A/C... I ended up opening a window... Def needs updating. -newline- The bathroom was clean but when they renovated it they failed to replace the faucets (which made a horrific squealing sound when you turned on the shower/tub- I'm sure the people next to me appreciated that when I showered at 3am!). The knob to turn the bath into a shower leaked profusely! The sink had old faucets too which also squeaked but not like the banshee-sounding shower! The mirror needs replaced. Period. It had black and brown age spots ALL over it giving the bathroom a feeling of uncleanliness! -newline- The bath towels were a dingy grey and old... -newline- The lock and key fob were a great pain! I stood outside my room for 5mins trying to get the lock to register the key... It was that touchy! -newline- Overall, it looks like they are in the process of renovating, and not completely finished... Parts were nice and parts were very poor. -newline- Like I said, they're trying but they're falling short... Not worth what I paid for the room.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-04-15	4	I only spent one night at the hotel. There was a free shuttle from the airport . My wait was about 20 minutes - OK. The room was clean and there is a nice restaurant attached plus a supermarket just across the street. The internet connection was free and good, the room was clean and quiet; the bed was comfortable and there was a fitness room in the hotel. Too bad about no coffee maker in the rooms as that would have made the stay even more enjoyable. All in it was a nice place and I recommend it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-04-04	4	Located near LAX with a shuttle every 15 minutes, the Hacienda Hotel felt much to me like a DoubleTree but cost substantially less. The only downside I found was that the bathtub/shower plumbing was a bit sub-par. I had to try three times to get the water coming out of the shower head completely, as opposed to having it split output between the shower head and the tub faucet. There was some mold under the tub mat too, but not so much as to concern me and nowhere that you would contact with your skin (UNDER the tub mat).	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-03-27	3	The shuttle picked me up at the airport, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful, from the front desk to housekeeping. The room was clean, although old. I had room service, which was very good food, and the device was outstanding. -newline- This is a perfect place to stay near the airport if you are laying over between flights, and I would stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-03-26	3	The location was handy for a quick layover at LAX. The 24 hour shuttle was a bonus for access from and back to LAX. The shuttle staff was courteous and efficient. For being so close to the airport the room was very quiet for traffic noise. The walls were somewhat thin and conversations from the room beside could be heard as well as the phone. The room was clean and average but the bathroom required some maintanence as the plaster was peeling from above the tub. There was no in room coffee making ability which would have been a plus. Overall, the room was average.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-03-20	4	I stayed here the night before I had to catch an early morning flight from LAX and it was close to the airport and they provided a shuttle service to my terminal. PLUS -- they let me park my car there for the four days I was gone and charged me only $8 per day! That's $4 per day LESS than the cheapest public parking lot at LAX! Excellent convenience & value!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-03-15	3	My wife and I stayed here on an overnight layover at LAX. The staff was very friendly, and the food at the diner across from the lobby was excellent. The room was clean, although it did seem old and needed some updating/repairs. -newline-  -newline- It wasn't fancy, but we got the sleep we needed and an early shuttle ride back to the airport. The Hacienda is a great option if you need to spend the night near LAX!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-03-04	4	I stay at this property regularly. It seems clean and is quiet and comfortable. The price is usually a good value. I recommend it.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-02-21	2	The room telephone didn't work. We were changed to another room where the phone didn't work either.

Hacienda Hotel		2012-02-02	5	I was very pleased that I could check in early (1:40 p.m.) and the room was ready. The room was very clean and elegantly furnished (plus nice pictures on the walls). The hotel lobby was beautiful and the desk staff was very helpful. I have stayed at the Hacienda several times over the last few years and it has always been a pleasureable experience. The only thing I would like to see is a coffee maker in the room. Other than that, I couldn't ask for anything more. It's a great hotel for someone who needs to be close to LAX and needs a shuttle bus. I will stay there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2012-01-11	3	Even though we had prepaid everything, clerk would not find our reservation. Only after I opened my computer, he believed us, but still found nothing in his records. Rooms are quite far from lobby, at second tower. Bed was comfortable, and romm was clean. Check out was quick and shuttle service efficient. I am still puzzled about a US$50 charge thrown into my credit card, by hotel, and waiting to see it canceled.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2011-12-31	2	Aside from the location, close to LA and close to Redondo Beach, I found the hotel staff not very accommodating, the room cleansiness somewhat below average, and the noise way too much. -newline- The towels had stains, the hotel seemed to have been renovated, but many things still point to its age. -newline- If you want to sleep in, good luck! The noise outside can be somewhat blocked or overlooked and I'm sure it'snot permenant, but the slamming of the room doors on the floor was horrible. Every time a door slammed, the whole room shook. -newline- I should probably also mention that I got what may seem to be a mis-dialed wake up call at around 4 am one morning. Yeah, not really what I bargained for. For the price I was paying, my friend stayed at the Westin and his room was really nice.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-12-28	3	close to airport, but the room is creepy. Don't feel very well with the bed. I need to call staff to fix the faucet so I can take a shower.

Hacienda Hotel		2011-12-11	1	Hi, -newline- I fly into LA a few times a year and usually stay at the LAX Travel Lodge. I decided to try something different this time. The Hacienda was $10.00 more expensive. -newline- They have no overnight luggage storage. The room was tiny and old . The plug on the tub did not work and the toliet ran all night. I would not go there again. The Travel Lodge was much better and $10.00 less.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2011-10-31	1	The location was great; Starbucks and Ralphs across the street...liked the free shuttle to/from the airport as well. -newline-  -newline- Other than that the hotel was not great. Very run-down hotel, staff not friendly and barely spoke English. I Pre-booked/bought 2 nights and I was so scared of the other sketchy hotel guests and the elevators omg. I literally thought I was not going to make it to my floor everytime I hoped on the elevator, Beware. I bought 2 nights but after the 1st night I went down the road and stayed at the Hilton LAX where I was very happy and felt safe and taken care of for like $20 more dollars a night. I would never recommend this hotel nor ever stay here again no matter the price.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-10-26	1	this place was a terrible. I paid $100 for a room expecting three star comfort. I needed to be close to lax. When i checked in the girl was rude. Then parking was terrible, to far. Then as i walk to my room the carpet and smell was disgusting. then I get to the room and the room was disgusting. I just couldn do it! I just left and got a room a double tree about 30 min away. I lost $00. on the room but there is know way i could stay at this place. the pics look good. this is why i was so shocked. I would pay $50.00 for this place.

Hacienda Hotel		2011-09-01	3	I had requested an ADA compliant room, which I suppose we got, however it was a good 3~5 minute walk from the lobby (with an 89 year old woman and a walker) and the worst of it was the 14" high bath tub she could not step into. the hand hold bars are not of much use if you cant get into the tub. Also the TV control DID NOT WORK, and the overall reception was not very great. The shuttle service was excellent, very convenient and the Drivers were very helpful with luggage.

Hacienda Hotel		2011-07-14	2	The room did not match the pictures and turned out to be more on the level of a Motel 6 for double the price. -newline-  -newline- The parking was a problem. The parking lot was full and cars were parked where ever they could. -newline-  -newline- The room was noisy and the pillows were so hard I had trouble falling a sleep. -newline-  -newline- All of this may be expected had the room not been expensive and have the price I paid for it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2011-07-07	3	The hacienda hotel is big and old, the paint is chipped off in alot of places and the elevator was malfunctioning 33% of the time. That being said, this was still a good buy. -newline-  -newline- I personally did not like how the pool closed at 8pm and opens at 8am.

Hacienda Hotel		2011-07-01	4	I was in the main building. The room only had one open socket, so we ended up unplugging a lot of stuff. We're pretty sure our room was haunted. Lights would turn on and off by themselves and so would the tv. The tv blew up at one point, but they quickly replaced it. Pool is nice.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-06-27	3	I stayed here twice (coming and going) and this experience describes both times. -newline-  -newline- Staff was friendly, hotel is decently clean. -newline- Checkin line wait is ridiculously long. Took 35 mins to process about 8 people working with 3 staff. -newline- Airport shuttle experience was great. -newline-  -newline- This hotel is great for arriving and departing but consider it basic accommodations only. I hate that they only give 2 small threadbare towels and plastic cups to drink the water. -newline-  -newline- Hotel is clean but you can see where they've patched things badly over the years. The elevators are a bit scary.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-06-21	1	Very old hotel. We had to wait to get checked in due to lack of help, then they did not have reservation[...] But biggest shock is NO AC. Here it is 80 degrees or more and no AC. They make it hard to know this as they hide this fact. We would have never stayed here and next time will sleep at LAX. Terrible hotel [...]	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2011-06-15	1	Unexpected charge was added to the bill.  Before leaving the hotel this morning, I was wondering how come I didn't have a receipt.  Therefore, instead of make an express check out which I really should, I stopped by the front desk and requested a receipt to be printed. A lady named [...] at front desk was very rude.  Not only didn't she print out receipt for me, but also she asked me to pay $5.00 parking that no one had mentioned to me while I was check in.  I parked my car in the parking lot of Hacienda Hotel by the South Tower where the sign showed that for Hacienda Hotel guest only.  And it didn't specify that the guest would pay $5.00 as parking charge.  Of cause I paid the parking then left.  But before leaving, I checked all the signs in the parking lot near by the South Tower again that none of them marked $5.00 parking for the hotel guest.  How ridicules it was if I had made an express check out I would save $5.00.  Also, the hotel is old.  It took me a while to make the faucet work before taking the shower.  Overall, I am very disappointed about the service and will never go back to Hacienda Hotel again no matter how attractive the price will be.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-05-30	2	Web showed a beautiful looking hotel, well this is a very old hotel and the room was small, dirty and had no A/C or Heating. First night we were so hot and the second night was freezing cold. Bathroom was extra small. (Could not close bathroom door if someone is sitting on toilet) -newline- The fan vent was solid black with yuk. -newline- When I ordered on-line web stated queen bed, called to comfirm, hotel stated they had not queen bed rooms, so I call orbiz and they stated that I would get two full size beds instead, but upon arrival they told me that I booked into a queen bed room and they had no knowledge of the two full size reservation.

Hacienda Hotel		2011-05-28	4	Very clean rooms and comfortable beds for the price. The friendly staff helped me get checked in quickly even though I arrived at 1 am. The open courtyard and pool also appeared appealing, but I was only at the hotel for a few hours, so I did not have time to investigate further. -newline-  -newline- The free 24 hour shuttle service runs every 15 minutes.

The hotel shuttle was prompt once we called and requested a pickup, and our room was older style, but clean, comfortable and quiet despite the many planes flying over. We checked in early, which was no problem for the friendly staff. There are many latin decorated nooks and courtyards that make this hotel very different from the local chain hotels. The hotel is situated directly across the street from over 5 cheap food options, however, we decided to dine in the hotel's restuarant which had decent food and great service (much faster than the local IHOP). Overall, a restful stay.

Hacienda Hotel		2011-03-26	3	A bit more than you average airport  inn. That said it is a bit on the older side of rustic and the road noise from Highway 1 is noticeable. I would not plan a long stay at this hotel unless you absolutely need to save cash. The rates were very competitive [...]. The hotel is a short drive to downtown el sugundo and the beach towns past that.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-03-24	3	Staff were very friendly. Food is available until 1am. Met a woman that complained about service but I feel she was the type that complain often instead of sorting for the positives. Shuttle service was punctual, room was clean. -newline-  -newline- Needs improvement: the bathroom needs to be detailed. Tile grout on the floor could use a good scrubbing and the shower nooks and crannies (under soap tray, under tub spout both had buildup). Hall carpet on 8th floor had an odor from water leakage. I heard a guest claim that it smelled of cat urine, but I'm sure that was not the case. It was clear where water leaked from most of the window frames I passed into the hall carpet. -newline-  -newline- I think it is tidy and friendly for a budget hotel. It was recommended to me by a flight attendant and I feel it was more than adequate for what I required. The food by the way was really inexpensive and had great flavor. -newline-  -newline- 5 STAR Location: minutes from LAX, Starbucks, Subway, many restaurants and a large retail grocery within a few steps of the hotel. You couldn't ask for more on a layover! -newline-  -newline- My advice, if you want more, pay more. If you are a simple person with good manners and you frequent hotels, you can understand minor infrastruture issues and appreciate friendly pricing. It's about wants vs. needs ;)	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2011-03-23	3	This hotel is definitely convenient to LAX. The room was clean and comfortable. If it weren't for noisy kids playing in the hallway until 11PM or so our one night would have been better. It was also pouring rain and there were a number of buckets in the lobby area. One of the sofas in the lobby was also getting dripped on.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-03-22	1	The staff are were very courteous, EXCEPT the shuttle bus driver. However, my issue w/ this hotel is.. the rooms need to be cleaned. Carpets were dirty (seriously needs a shampoo), the room smelled like cigarettes, I stated on my reservation the room was for 2, my room only had towels for one person, I had to call the front desk twice for extra towels,no extra shampoo or conditionder, soap, etc. just terrible. It was like staying at a Motel 8 instead of a place that had a high star rankings [...]... Lastly... I mentioned the Shuttle Buss driver.. I had to be at the airoprt by 5:30 am. Driver showed up and as he took my luggage to load.. I'm very polite.. always say please, thank you, etc. Well, immediately when this guy took my luggage he gave me the most horrible attitude, never said "you're welcome" when I thanked him, when I got to the airport I once again said thank you.. and the jerk gave me the silent treatment, yet when the gentleman behind me thanked him.. he spoke to him!!?! I don't know what the prejudice was towards me but, it was complete disrespect.. Needless to say.. I WILL NOT EVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN... I don't care how bad I need a room..	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2011-02-20	1	I travel to LA once a month and always stay at the Embassy Suites. This time they were booked and I ended up staying at the Hacienda for a higher rate. This hotel is in terrible condition, the elevators are a scary ride, they shake and make noices, the carpet in the hallways is literally coming off, the service is terrible exept for the shuttle service to the airport. I had to go to three different floors to find a working ice machine, the TV was so old that the picture was hardly viewable, I can go on and on. Avoid this hotel!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-02-20	3	Room was nice and clean which is important, however, the hotel consisted of several individual buildings.  I stayed in the South building which wasn't staffed and was adjacent to a busy street and the hotel parking lot.  Building location and lack of staff made it feel unsafe to a single traveler.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-02-20	3	We found the pickup at LAX to be slow. The check in had two desk clerks, so check in was slow.

Hacienda Hotel		2011-02-17	3	My husband and I went to get away for a few nights during the week. It was a nice place the rooms were very comfortable and had everything we needed.

However we had a nice view of the garden and pool and enjoyed that.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-02-17	4	Hotel room was decent and service was good.  Food at the cafeteria was average.  Only complaint is that room walls are too thin.

Hacienda Hotel		2011-02-17	4	This is an older, classic El Segundo hotel. Its not new and maybe on the "wrong side" of the LAX runways, but a great deal for the price. The lobby areas are colorfully decorated in Mexican colors, the rooms are clean and safe. They have 24/7 shuttles to LAX every 20 minutes and apparently are a popular stop for international travellers with an overnight at LAX. The coffee shop is 24/7 and good. The bar has dancing (swing, hustle, etc.) each night that provides some entertainment from a bar stool. I was just here for local business and declined to pay the price for a Century Blvd hotel. Scores are relative to the price and age.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-02-15	3	Minutes from LAX and located near affordable resturants. No parking structure which can result in a long walk to your vehicle. Hotel has one Central air unit so you get either heating or A/C, you have no choice. Pros: clean, affordable, nice location, friendly staff, comfortable, shopping approx 3 miles south.  Cons: parking, the central air system.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2011-01-31	4	Second time staying here. Free trolley to the airport that leaves twice an hour. (I used last time, not this time, its along one street to the airport) -newline-  -newline- I enjoy staying here and will probably stay additional times whenever I need to stay near LAX. -newline-  -newline- Good quality linens, carpet was clean, no odd smells in the room, bathroom is more spacious then most.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-01-30	3	Pretty average hotel room, but the courtyards are better than expected for the money.  The hotel wifi works there too, so I could get my work done next to a fountain instead of a room, which was nice. -newline-  -newline- The parking lots, however, were somewhat inconvenient.  Both were located away from the hotel, and I had to make several trips across the street with luggage.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2011-01-16	3	We found the hotel to be quite good for an overnight stay prior to going on a cruise.  Shuttle service & breakfast the next morning were appreciated.

Hacienda Hotel		2011-01-06	3	We booked very late when our flight out was canceled.  We got to the hotel at 5AM. The desk clerk and security guy were wonderful but we were not happy to have to change room because the first one had no heat. We got to sleep at 7AM.  We had to check out by 2 and spent 2-7 in the lobby and bar, working on our claim.  It was freezing in the lobby and not much warmer in the bar.  I have a cold now.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2011-01-03	4	We got a great deal on this hotel [...].  But when we got there in the late evening, they gave us a room in the West Wing building.  It is very poorly lit and old in the West Wing.  My wife and I were not comfortable staying there.  I asked for a different room and they gave us a room in the main building for no extra charge.  It was much better.  So if you don't stay in the West Wing building, it is a good hotel.  Cheap parking and a bunch of restaurants close by.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-12-23	3	Among the hotels around LAX airport, we chose this one because of the price within the same radius from the airport.

However, when I tried to use the shower, I moved the shower curtain an inch and the whole rod came tumbling down, because it was broken. We were leaving and did not have an issue, but if they had tried to charge us, I would have not been happy.

Hacienda Hotel		2010-10-10	4	Hotel is close to Manhattan Beach, for Starbucks lovers there is one located right across the street. Hotel is dated, but one cannot beat the price.

Hacienda Hotel		2010-10-06	5	I used this hotel for a weekend in L.A. to watch a college football game at USC. This hotel was great as it was just about 1 mile from LAX (airport)The aiprot provides a free shuttle to and from the airport, bonus. The rates are incredible reasonable/low. Room service is really affordable and all the other amenities available to the traveling guest are right there at the hotel. At this hotel you can relax at a full bar and grill and even rent a car on location! I felt like I was at a budget resort of some kind, unbelieveable friendly staff and clean comfortable rooms. I think I'll be staying here everytime I come to L.A. as there is no better deal for all the things that you get staying at this hotel, wow!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-09-06	1	After a long trip in motorcycle from Dallas, visiting various national parks, LA was my place to rest, before coming back.

Hacienda Hotel		2010-08-26	2	Im a local, so when I booked this hotel in El Segundo I actually expected the rooms to be nicer than they were. My bathroom door didn't close properly, the paint was pealing from the wall, and door to enter our room didn't close either. The room was clean but it did have a certain smell to it. Almost like they used an aerosol to mask the smell of cigarettes. The employees were extremely nice however, so thats always good. The hotel is centrally located from several restaurants and stores that within walking distance. All in all it was pleasant stay but I probably wouldn't stay at the hacienda hotel if I had the choice.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-08-26	5	I like this hotel in El Segundo, I have stayed several time on short business trips. It is close to LAX but not right on top of it. It is very close to freeways, there is a fridge in the room and the Mariposa restaurant is good. There are supermarkets, Starbucks and restaurants across the street and a Walgreens one block down. El Segundo offers a free lunch time shuttle into the center of town between 11.30am and 2pm. It is good for the office staff close to Grand Avenue and close to the Hacienda for pick up and drop off. The drivers are really helpful and Main St. El Segundo has some nice cafes. If you have a car, its, less than a mile or so to the beach. This and the great pool at the Hacienda helps you forget the proximity to industrial operations. The room was clean, very comfortable bed. What more can I say? I will go back again. Oh yes, they have an airport shuttle too.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-08-26	5	Hotel stay very nice. price great through [website]. The only drawback was to use the computer--there would be a minimum of $5.95 charge. All I would have liked was to print out my boarding pass; and despite the note that said minimum $1 fee, it is really a minimum $5.95. -newline- Preset, but hardy breakfast came with the stay. Staff was very helpful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-08-17	1	this was a trip to my son's college graduation.  When we arrived at the hotel, the room we were assigned had not been cleaned.  We were given another room which was small and smelled stale.  Beacause we did not have a lot of time, we took the room and bought candels to freshen the room.when checking in they did not tell us where parking was and when I inquired at the desk, they treated me with suspicion, which was very unnerving. after returning to our room for the evening we heard a scratching at the door and someone was trying to enter our room.  I went to the door and realized they had given our room to another person.  When we let the front desk know, they apoligized and gave us free breakfast chits.  Something that was already included inour package.[...]	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-08-10	3	We went to LA on vacation. We chose the Hacienda because of the great location and awesome price. The room was hard to find and parking was a little far. We had to park behind a gas station because they ran out of room. The room was clean and served our needs. The bathroom floor was not. We found a few hairs on the floor and on the toliet seat. I would possibly stay here again if I was looking for something simple with no frills.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-07-22	3	The Hacienda Hotel is clean, reasonably priced and relatively close to LAX.  I wanted a place to sleep between flights and it served that purpose adequately.  The breakfast in its restaurant was good and what I would have ordered (eggs, sausage and toast) if I had had a choice.  Their shuttle service was excessively slow.  I had to wait more than 30 minutes for pick up, watching the shuttle buses for other hotels go by.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-07-22	3	The common areas of this hotel are quite beautiful.  It was nice having an attached restaraunt and lots of other restaraunts and a grocery store within a short walk.  The rest of the hotel is very old and very much in need of renovations.  I noticed a lot of mold/mildew in the bathrooms, on ceilings, etc. so if you suffer allergies this is probably not the place for you.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-07-18	4	I love everything about the hotel except the transportation shuttles.  They did not stop at the LAX bus station or the Aviation Metro Train station.  I wish they had a shuttle stop at the Metro Train station so guests like me can hop a bus to Santa Monica or go to Downtown LA via train.  It would be a nice option to advertise to the guest at the hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-07-13	1	I was so disappointed in this Hotel and would not recommend it to anyone. They were not accommodating at all and to have had to pay to park in their parking lot was absurd! The Hotel was in shambles and the door did not lock properly so I had to stick a chair under the doorknob in fear that someone would break in. I did not sleep at all that night and will never try this Hotel ever again. I will go back to Hampton Inn where I know the room is clean and the doors lock properly.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-07-09	4	If you are looking for sleek and modern, go elsewhere. This hotel has a special charm. It reminded me of the song "Hotel California" but it was easy to check in and out. I liked the Spanish decor and surroundings. My children didn't like the hotel. They did not appreciate the ambience. This hotel would be a nice place for a romantic get away. Go dancing downstairs cha cha etc and then get a room for the night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-07-07	4	This was a comfortable and affordable place to relax in between legs of my journey.

Hacienda Hotel		2010-07-06	4	The Hacienda is a perfect overnighter for LAX. It's inexpensive and has some character but it's still reasonably clean and well ordered.

Hacienda Hotel		2010-07-02	2	The halls, stairway, and elevator had a kinda bad smell going on. The elevator was super tiny. However, the room was okay.

Hacienda Hotel		2010-06-30	2	A refrigerator is an essential.  Thus I will make sure that with future bookings the room has a refrigerator, or one is available.  Further I will not book again with a hotel with such small rooms.  For what we got the price paid was excessive.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-06-26	2	Looking at pictures of the hotel I thought I was getting a good deal for what I paid.  It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't great either. I was put in a smoking room when I requested non-smoking but the hotel staff was extremely polite and accommodating. The parking lot was always full so that was annoying.  All in all it was an ok hotel but you could probably find something nicer for the same price.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-06-23	4	We have stayed at the Hacienda several times.  Always happy with the rooms and service.  However, this time we encountered a few problems.  One of the outlets in our room didn't work and couldn't be fixed during our stay.  The heat lamp in the bathroom had slipped out of its base and was just hanging by the wires.  The parking lots were always full and the entry gate didn't always work.  But, as I said - this is the only time we've had any problems.  The staff is always helpful and friendly.  The coffee shop is great - good breakfasts.  We would stay there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-06-08	3	Pros and cons.  There for business.  Location was much better than those places right off airport.  This had access to more immediate restuarants, food and coffee joints.  However - it was clearly a very old place, and despite some well intentioned efforts to update it - the age of this place shown thru.  However, the rooms are not bad with decent desk and free wifi (not $10 a night like other larger chains off LAX).   All in all, a good value thru location and amenities - despite some elderly crumbling goin on.  Staff was excellent by the way !	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-05-25	3	I needed an inexpensive hotel next to LAX.  I wasn't looking for all the bells and whistles just a clean room with a bed as this was just for one night.  The bed wasn't the most comforatble (no pillow top) but I wasn't expecting it for the price.  If i needed something longer, I would probably choose something different, but this was fine for me for one night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-02-27	1	We were willing to overlook the age of the hotel, because it was almost charming. But there is absolutely no soundproofing between rooms, and the guy upstairs kept us awake ALL NIGHT!!! None of us got any sleep and we were all absolutely exhausted for our long flight the next day. We were going to change rooms, but we kept hoping this guy would fall asleep... No such luck! We got up, got dressed, and went down for breakfast at 5 a.m.!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-02-23	3	Good Value and location close to airport with convenient airport shuttle.  I was in town for one day to take a licensing exam for medical school which was a short 15 minute walk away on Sepulveda.  I imagine this hotel would be very good for people who have layovers or disruption in their travel plans and need to spend another night in LA.  Food at bar was OK, not great, but I didn't try the other restaurant.

I really liked my oversized room with a balcony that overlooked a very nicely landscaped courtyard below. Overall, I was very pleased with this hotel. I found the photos on this hotel's website actually matched what I saw in person. So that was BIG PLUS to me. This hotel had a very nice decor throughout the hotel, and it had a very nice cozy ambiance. -newline-  -newline- My only 4 complaints are: The elevator runs very slow and the lights were out on all of the buttons on the elevator, so you never knew what floor the elevator was on while you were waiting for it. Then when the elevator finally comes and you press the button for your floor, the button does not illuminate. The hallways to the rooms need to be updated. I stayed on the 5th floor, however since the elevator was so slow, I always used the stairway to walk down to the first floor, since it was much quicker. Also, I tried the coffee shop at this hotel (Mariposas Restaurant). However the service was very, very slow, poor, and unfriendly. Since there were 2 waiters serving about 8 people while I dined there, I could not believe how poor & slow the service was. So I would recommend going to one of the local coffee shops or restaurants down the street from this hotel. Yet other than that, I liked this hotel. -newline-  -newline- For the value, I would definitely stay at this hotel again, however I do not think I would patronize any of the restaurants at this hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-02-22	3	Had heard there were very nice renovated rooms, however, we did not get one. Our room was old and dated, with missing light fixture at door, damaged woodwork in bathroom.  It was, however, clean....thank goodness!  Staff was VERY pleasant and accommodating.  Okay if you just needed a bed for the night, but not for much else.  Disappointing, I'm afraid to say.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-02-19	4	I had to get a place that provided airport transfere because I was comming in from a long business trip and meeting someone in LA.  The hotel provided free transportation that was convient. I also like the locations because there was other resturants to walk to and they provided transportation to the mall.  The resturant and lounge there at the hotel was nice too.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2010-02-18	1	Trip was great, but I didn't get much sleep because it was so hot in the room. With central air conditioning, they had the heat on at night and I was not able to cool the room off at all. They did not help at front desk. There is no way to control the temp. in each room individually if you need it cooler than other people like. I will never recommend nor stay there again. The only bad part of the L.A. trip. There is a charge for parking too!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-01-26	3	The waiting room and surronding area is very nice and tastefully decorated. Reception is terrible, the people are friendly but I do not understand why it takes 10 minutes (literally) to check in each person. The line to check in was going out the door. The hallways and hotel rooms do not match the nice decor of the reception area. Some of the buttons to floors on the elevator didn't work and one of the two elevators didn't work at all. The woman next to us was unable to get into her room for over an hour because her key didn't work and the hotel could not figure out what to do	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2010-01-13	3	We only stayed there one night, just to get to LAX in the morning, and for that purpose it was good enough. i wouldnt want to stay there for a longer then that. The interior of the hotel is dated and gives off a strange vibe.  My husband hated it, but for the price, and the fact that we were only there to sleep, it was fine.  The redeeming aspects of the hotel is the nice outside courtyard, and that alot of rooms have balconies overlooking the courtyard. The restaraunt attached was perfect for a good breakfast before the airport.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2009-12-16	3	Not bad for the price.  Stayed overnight since the hotel was hosting an exam for work in the morning.  Room was small, but very clean and quiet.  Check-in was a breeze, staff was friendly.  Location is next door to a Carl's Jr and across from Sizzler, Ralphs supermarket, and a bunch of other eateries.  Bed was too firm, but pillows were plush.  Amenities were inconvenient (i.e. ice machine was in a different wing).  $5 seems unnecessary for parking in the lot; it didn't seem any more secure than parking on a side street.  Overall, a pleasant stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2009-12-07	5	Very friendly and efficient staff.  The airport shuttle was a God-send and the room was clean and quiet.  Dinner in the lounge was tasty, well prepared and inexpensive.  I can see why many people on the shuttle were airline staff.  They know a good thing when they find it.  Very latino in decor and amenities so it was quite a change from what we see here in Montana.  The little patios outside with benches, flowers and fountains were nice on a winter's evening.  One even had a lit fireplace in the corner.  Overall, I liked it a lot and will go back when the need arises.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2009-12-04	5	My hotel room was on the fourth floor in the main building. It had a balcony with table and chairs and was shaded by a beautiful tree which created amazing privacy. It was a very quiet and restful place to stay. The other things I liked about the Haciendo were the convenience of walking to restuarants, shops, the wonderful neigborhood area behind the hotel for morning walks, and the spacious lobby and adjoining courtyard to sit and relax.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2009-07-29	1	great location, but that was about it. Staff did not know how to explain things, not very friendly. they close the pool at sunset, which i think is too early...we came back to the hotel shortly after sunset, and we did not even get to see the pool. We stayed on the 7th floor, and all the windows in the hallway were open without any screens. we did not have children with us, but it can be a safety issue when small children are around. service was not good as well at their restaurant. we decided not to come back here again. for the price we paid for our room, i was expecting much more, and I have stayed at the hotels where they have better service for much more reasonable prices.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2009-07-12	5	We had read all of the previous reviews and were more than a little nervous about our upcoming hotel stay.  The was the best loction as I was just a block away from the training location I was going to.  Needless to say we were VERY happy with our room (we stayed in the South tower - with the portal-type window/doors that were able to open all the way).  The ONLY complaint was that the bed was a little too hard.  The TV in our room was very dark and red.  The staff was very quick to replace  the tv as they were unable to fix it.

Hacienda Hotel		2009-07-02	1	I never post a review for any hotels that I stay in. But this one is an exception..I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT! We arrived late from the airport and when we checked in our room, it had the old hotel smell, musty. We asked for another room, which they gave us and its odor was not as bad.  I figured one night,okay. Not so, we finally got into bed at about midnight and could hear snoring from who knows where. Then at about 2am other noises. Then the room somewhere, upstairs or next door had a 4am wake up call which rang 4xs before they answered,and I could hear their whole conversation until they left. Then at 7am the hotel decided to do some heavy cleaning nearby. It was a horrible experience. When checking out, I had to pay a parking fee. Once again, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2009-06-08	3	Very nice hotel for the price. We flew into LAX late and night and just wanted a basic hotel by the airport before driving out to our destination the next morning. -newline-  -newline- Everything was very clean. The lobby and hallways are nicely decorated. Nice breakfast at the restaurant. Really good water pressure in the shower. -newline-  -newline- The airport shuttle seemed to take a long time to arrive - definitely call the hotel when you arrive and they'll send it out. -newline-  -newline- I was worried about the bed. The mattress needs to be replaced - I like firm mattresses, but this one was like a rock and it bounced every time my husband or I moved. I slept well enough though. The towels were small and thin and only two were provided. I could have used both myself. -newline-  -newline- The Hacienda would be my first choice if I needed to stay right by the airport at LAX again. Good price for the level of cleanliness and I like that it has some character over the chains.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2009-05-29	5	The Hacienda is a very pretty & restful place to stay. We wanted a place near the airport because we had early morning return flights. Hacienda fit the bill perfectly and it also had shuttles running regularly. The rooms were spotlessly clean and odor-free & the bathrooms were clean, pleasant and everything worked as it should. The staff were friendly and helpful. We didn't get a chance to try their restaurants but they had about 3 in-house restaurants. Location-wise, the area was good, it had a fair amount of eateries and fast-food places right across the street and a Walgreen's right next to the hotel. It is about 20-30 mins from any of the touristy places but with a car its not a problem. There is enough space for parking and they charge a nominal parking fee per day. The hotel provides very good value for the money. It provides the same service as its much pricier counterparts. It was our first visit to LA and I would definitely stay there the next time I visit it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2009-05-22	5	We were so pleased with the whole stay and the food was ridiculously great!!! Great servers, and housekeeping was awsome....Room service was kickin' and the staff was always extremely helpful and courteous!!!!  :)  My fiance and I will stay there again if and when travelling to LA in the future., and we will refer our friends and family to Hacienda Hotel. The courtyards are in perfect shape and the flowers are beautiful and just so well taken care of....the staff is cleaning and tending to the guests 24/7......Can't compare and will stay here again......	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2009-05-22	2	We were given a tiny room on the 2nd floor over the street right next to the elevator that was so noisy we could never have slept, so we requested a different room. Both of us are handicapped, and the hotel staff knew this, but the new room was a huge hike to a separate part of the hotel then another huge hike from the elevator. There was no refrigerator for my meds, so we requested one. When it arrived it was so old and filthy we were disgusted. -newline- If I could have just left, I would have.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2009-05-14	3	I had an interview at a corporation just down the street. The staff were friendly and helpful and I liked the set up of the room. The room was clean and stocked. The only set back I have to say anything about is the view...my room on the 6th(?) floor of the southern tower had a view of the hotel dumpster. While not idyllic, it was a nice and restful place for my brief trip. I would recommend it if you are in the L.A. area and have plans near LAX because of it's convenient location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2009-05-13	4	We were very pleased with our room, not with the parking arrangements, especially the distance from parking lot to the room.  I think it is possible to improve this by assigning temporary parking for checking-in, and different parking lots for different wings of the hotel.  Also making sure is only one car per room.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2009-05-11	5	It was such a warm hotel.  Many areas to just sit outside and read, talk with other travelers or your own party.  Nice restaurant right next door and many across the street. The hotel shuttle was great, they took you to local attractions for free and had the airport shuttle to and from.  I wish when we go back next year we could find one closer to where we need to be because we would go in a heart beat!  The price was such a steal for what we had!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2009-05-11	2	Our room was not clean.   The shower (hot and cold nobs were reversed) and toilet were so noisy.

Hacienda Hotel		2009-05-04	2	Very convenient shuttle service to LAX.  Parking was ok. When I went to plug in my computer behind night stand next to bed, there was an empty condom wrapper.  At least it was empty.  Maybe rooms could be checked better.  Have stayed her before, didn't like the location of room.  Probably will not stay again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2009-05-04	3	I need to control my own a/c. This was not good for me. I slept with the window open and there was no screen. And I did not like the parking the fact that I had to pay for parking each night was a little upsetting when the parking was around the corner. From this experience I will be sure to look for these 2 important details for other overnight stays.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2009-05-04	3	The hotel itself is beautiful.. sometimes staff were unfriendly,, but for the most part,, ,the rest of the staff were real friendly... as we left to catch our flight early in the AM,,,. there was a fight between some young men right out front!!!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2009-04-24	4	Stayed overnight on way to and return from Hawaii.  Hotel was clean and convenient for someone who has never been in LA Noisy due to closeness to LAX.

Hacienda Hotel		2009-04-22	4	this was my second stay at the Hacienda Hotel. I plan to stay here every time I fly into LAX. It's a quick drive from the airport and the welcome I receive here is sincere and friendly - just what I need after a late arrival following a 6 hour flight. the hotel is definitely old and doesn't have that antiseptic sameness that the big chains have. If you stay here, be sure to enjoy an excellent breakfast at the restaurant. All in all, it's a one of a kind, very friendly hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2009-03-19	1	I arrived at LAX and called the hotel and was advised that the shuttle would pick me up in 10 minutes. I re-called the hotel in 30 minutes and again was told the shuttle was on its way. After 1 hour I called again and was told the same story. Finally i hitched a ride with the Doubletree shuttle who took me to the hotel for free 90 minutes after my first call to the hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2009-03-03	4	What's not to like at the Hacienda? Have stayed there many times and it is great value.  Could do with a little work on its air conditioning for the warmer months, but we like it just the way it is.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-12-17	4	We live about 40 miles from the airport so to avoid the stress of a very early morning drive, we stayed at the Hacienda. We didn't need anything fancy, but it was clean, efficient, and friendly. The free van to the airport was worth it all.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-12-09	4	The overall experience was satiifactory for us.  The hotel was a bit run down.  When we left in the morning, one of the elevators that were already very old and slow broke down.  People were stuck in the hallway with luggages.  Lucky for us we left our luggage in the car, so we just took the stairs down.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2008-12-04	5	I participated in the hotels park and fly program.  I stayed at the hotel the night before my trip, and parked my car at the hotel lot for 5 nights.  The lot was well lit and secure.  The value was excellent.      All other aspects of the hotel met my needs perfectly. The restaurant is very good.      I would hightly recommend this hotel to my friends.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-11-19	5	We arrived early in the morning (6am) at the Hacienda Hotel, El Segundo, California and were immediately given a room.  We had been traveling for two days without a hotel and were so pleased to be able to get to our room and shower right away.  We had a 7:30 breakfast date with our grandson so being able to freshen up was very much appreciated.     The shuttle service, both to and from the airport and to local shopping areas was the best.   Our room was pleasant and well taken care of.  We would definitely stay here again if the opportunity presented itself.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-09-22	3	Overall I liked the location and the amenities. However, parking was at best inadequate. Plus the air took too long to cool the room. I also think that a nicer TV should be part of your standard equipment. I think the staff was quite friendly and helpful, and dining was excellent.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-08-01	5	We had a great stay at the Hacienda Hotel and would recommend it to everyone! Clean rooms, friendly staff and a fast shuttle to LAX right in the middle of the night.

Hacienda Hotel		2008-07-09	1	The Hacienda hotel was such a dump, I left as soon as I could. Staff was nice enough but this place is a pit. Even though I was only mildly repulsed at check-in (exterior is rundown); the minute I saw my room, I left.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-06-30	1	THE HACIENDA HOTEL WAS DISAPPOINTING IN MANY WAYS. . FIRST OF ALL WHEN WE WALKED INTO OUR ROOM THERE WAS A MUSTY ORDER.  WE ASKED THE MAID FOR A ROOM SPRAY AND THAT HELPED.  AT 11:30 P.M. THERE WAS SO MUCH NOISE COMING FROM THE COURTYARD I CALLED SECURITY TO COMPLAIN.  I CALLED AGAIN AT 12:30 A.M. AND AGAIN AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 A.M.  SECURITY CAME AND POUNDED ON OUR DOOR AT ONE POINT. .I TOLD HIM THROUGH THE DOOR THE NOISE WAS COMING FROM THE COURTYARD. . NOT OUR ROOM.  WE HARDLY SLEPT A WINK ALL NIGHT.  I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-06-27	5	I was on my way to Anaheim for a conference and my plane got to LAX late in the evening, so I was looking for a convenient location to spend the night.  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating, and there's a great pool and outside seating area. The room was very clean and smoke free.  Free transportation to LAX, and it's only a few blocks from the airport, and it's easy walking distance to offsite restaurants.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-06-25	5	From the outside this hotel does not look like much but once you pull in to the turnabout you will quickly realize that you are in for something special.  You walk into the main lobby and see people from what appears to be every nation, speaking in various languages, yet each person has the same familiar expression... a pleasantly surprised smile.      The hotel staff were quick to check us in and even  offered dining suggestions without being asked.  We opted for room service and I have to admit that in all the hotels we have ordered room service none compare to the this hotel.  They answered the phone quickly when called, gave a time when the food would be delivered, they exceeded expectation by delivering it well before their stated time, AND the food was HOT and GOOD!      The bed was very nice and quite soft, yet supportive.  The bathroom was a bit small but the hot water was hot immediately and the room was well ventilated.      The only down side was parking.  It's across the street but in reality it was a very short walk, 2-3 minutes.  The upside to the parking situation was the patrol that was visible both when we arrived and when we left.      If you are fortunate to have a room overlooking the atrium you are in for a treat.  The water fountain is amazing beautiful and the entire patio was pleasantly situated.      All in all my wife and I were very surprised.  We've never heard of Hacienda Hotel and questioned if we should stay there.  After our experience, there is no question where we will stay when we're in the area.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-06-20	5	The hotel itself was beautiful.  Nice courtyard, good pool, pretty garden.  The neighborhood was good, quiet, and felt safe.  My only disappointment was that it was not too accessible to tourist places, unless you rent a car.  Then parking at hotel was always full, so had to park in additional hotel parking across the street (behind gas station) - also pretty full most of time. But that's pretty much true for LA not just the hotel.  Hotel was very close to LAX.  They have a rental service by check-in.  Internet access in the lobby as well.  The adjoining restaurant Mariposa was nice, people there were very friendly.  Breakfast was great.  Had a problem with the toilet in my room.  When I advised them - maintenance fixed it right away.  The staff handling guest services could have been more helpful, they barely answered my questions about where to go but the rest of the staff was friendly and helpful.  Overall, I really enjoyed my stay with my 8-yr-old daughter - we felt safe (highly important factor).	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-06-10	4	The Hacienda Hotel is very close to the LAX airport,maybe 10minutes. The hotel has a new and old buildings.My son and I shared a room with 2 queen beds that were in the old part of the hotel.We stayed for 6 nights.The room had a little outside deck area which over looked a parking area for delivery drivers.But the noise wasn't a distraction. The room did not have a micowave oven,or a small fridge and the only sink was in the small bathroom.The coffee pot was only enough for 1 cup,and tasted like hotel coffee.The room was only big enough for 2 adults and the end of the beds were very close to the tv stand,dresser,and that 1 extra chair.There was a standard room desk with a lamp,phone,and that 1 cup coffee pot.The closet was big enough for 4 suitcases plus allot of area for our hang up clothes.More  hangers were needed.Bathroom was standard,plenty of hot water.The air conditioner had 4 settings and worked great.Parking was $5.00 a day.24 hour room service,food was just ok.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-06-05	4	It served my purpose very well. I needed to break up a trip to and from New Zealand. Their shuttle service to LAX was quite good. Staff was friendly and courteous.

Hacienda Hotel		2008-04-09	2	The Hacienda Hotel in El Segundo, California, is a somewhat older hotel that does not have individual room air conditioning.  Instead, it is centrally controlled throughout the hotel, as as a result, it became very warm in my room at night, when the hotel air was either off or turned down very low.      Upon check-in, the room had not been cleaned, and the front desk and housekeeping had not communicated that it needed to be cleaned. Although I had requested an early check-in time of 2:00 p.m., I had to call housekeeping myself to request that my room be cleaned, and it was 2:15 p.m. (normal check-in is 3:00 p.m.)      also, the housekeeping staff lost my husband's swim trunks, which were on the bed when we left for the day and not there when we returned.  The next day, the Manager-On-duty, gave us a hard time about reimbursing the amount we paid to purchase new trunks so we could go into the pool again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-04-09	2	This is an old hotel that has been partially remodeled, but only as far as the front desk, lobby, club and restaurant areas.      The room reeked of stale odors, smoke, and the heating/ac left much to be desired.  I had to open the window in order to adjust the temperature as well as tolerate the odors.      The bath only had a shower stall, and was positioned so close to the wall I had to squeeze to get in and out of the shower.      I'd recommend the bar's dance floor,and the food was average in the restaurant - nothing else was worth nearly the money I spent for it.      After I arrived at the hotel (and spent $20 on a cab to arrive), I was told about their courtesy van to/from LAX.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-04-07	5	My wife and I visited our two college kids With the high cost of college The rates here were appreciated.  I feel we got our moneys worth.     The only gripe I have has to do with two things.  The front desk attendant should have been more understanding.  And the hotel overnite parking on Saturday night was awful.  Other than that i would tell my friends to stay there.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2008-03-09	3	I was staying at the Hacienda, and had a conference at the LAX Hilton.  Taxis were $15 for less than one mile and the shuttle would not take us there.

Hacienda Hotel		2008-03-04	5	I found the Hacienda Hotel to be very convenient. My business was made much easier by the fact that it is minutes from LAX, close to major freeways & has a convenient shuttle to & from LAX every 15 or 20 minutes, 24-hours a day. I appreciated my quiet & spacious room on the 5th floor of the South Tower. I enjoyed the hotel's comfortable patio & it's very courteous and friendly staff. It was very helpful that there are several fast food restaurants, a supermarket, Starbucks, a bank and a 24-hour pharmacy within walking distance of the Hacienda.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2008-02-18	4	The Hacienda Hotel was very nice, clean and comfortable.  The rooms are just the perfect size for either a short or a long stay.  The beds are comfortable, the rooms are clean, and the bathrooms are big and functional.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The location is perfect.  It is surrounded by several restaurants, supermarket, pharmacy, gas stations, and even banks.  Easy and fast access to freeway and airport.

Hacienda Hotel		2008-01-31	5	I really enjoy the court yards an out door fireplace in the even was lovely and the sitting areas of the other court yards was so pleasant I went and sat out side and thought now this is what California is about the comforter and flowers and the breezy weather and sunshine and palm trees and clean lovely surroundings And all of this so close and near the airport who would of thought, Oh and the shampoo and lotions was a real treat good size and the cool thing about it was I could use the computers  in the lounge and didn?t have to wait for one there where about 6 or more for customer use.  I would continue to going back with out any hesitation very clean and comfortable room I had and very good light in the room which is sometime very tough  to fine good lighting to get make up in. The Hacienda Hotel,   I'll be back!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2008-01-03	4	The Hacienda was full of charm and curb appeal.  I love the fountain-courtyard and the roomy lobby with overstuffed chairs and sofas. And if you need internet, there were several computers available for use, as well as, access in your room.  The room given to us was less than expected.  We had the corner room top floor and it seemed a bit cramped.  We arrived early and had to wait for the room to be cleaned (not a problem). Hotel staff cleaned it early for us.  My daughter enjoyed the adequate workout facility.  There was plenty of gated parking for a fee, but, I was confused on exactly the best route to get to it.  A shopping plaza, the airport, and  is located only a few blocks away. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at The Hacienda	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2007-12-08	5	Hacienda is so convenient to the airport , yet a nice distance from it to avoid noise. Easy access to Local sights and the beaches are nearby too.

Hacienda Hotel		2007-12-04	3	The hotel is somewhat dated.      The Portion of hootel I was put is somewhat dated, about 1960s. I had issues with the follow ites:      1. Wireless internet did not work in my room.   2. Internet cost in the busness center was      expensive.   3. Lamp switch on working desk did not work.   4. The controls for heating/air conditioning      did not work correctly(you eirher had full      on heat or not heat).   5. Room was some what small.   6. No refregiator in room.   7. Parking entry and exit system did not      correctly for my my whole stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2007-11-22	1	First of all, they made my son and I move 4 times in one day, because we were told the room keys had to be changed on the week of thanksgving which we thought that was not very smart to do.       We ended up going back to the room where we moved from after three tries at three other rooms which didn't have a good internet connection, another room was very noisy and when we got to our last room the manager was wondering why we were asked to change rooms in the first place because that section of the rooms was not having the keys replaced. I went to bed at 1:00 a.m., going throught the husle and I had to get up early next day to go to work. I thought that was totally unnecessary. My son and I din't need any of this husle. Besides a day after staying at the hotel, we had to call for room service in the evening. The room was not cleaned up nor serviced at all. We had to call it in. This has been the worse hotel experience my family and I have ever experenced.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2007-08-01	5	The Hacienda Hotel is one of the best values in hotels near the LAX.  And you don't sacrafice a beautiful facility.  The rooms are not brand new, but they are very pleasant and comfortable.  Any time I am in this area, I'm staying at the Hacienda.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2007-08-01	3	It is very convenient and the free shuttle is the best feature of the hotel.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2007-07-17	5	Excellent food, clean rooms and friendly people, although the check in was slow as they didn't seem to care if you checked in or not. Was a small line waiting.

Hacienda Hotel		2007-06-17	3	If you need a hotel just for 1 night,as we did,because of flights leaving LAX-the hotel was alright.All we wanted was a bed to sleep in.Old hotel,check in took a while,only 2 desk clerks working.Not in the best area of L.A.   But close to airport   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2007-06-15	5	The best thing about this hotel is the Stay and Park feature. If you stay at the hotel you can park your car for up to 7 days at the hotel.  All for around $150.   The rooms are very clean - bathrooms looked newly remodeled.  The fitness room is small but all equipment is newer and nice.  LOTS of restaurants in the hotel including a bar, Mexican restaraunt, and diner style eatery with great coffee and breakfasts.  Starbucks, a grocery store, Subway, El Pollo Loco, etc are across the street.   1 mile south of LAX so very convenient for travellers including a free shuttle to and from the hotel.   The hotel grounds look as though a Mexican has decorated the Queen Mary - that is the best way I can think to describe it!  It has a boat like feel with hacienda style!  Very clean and well maintained, but don't expect anything too fancy or prissy.   The rooms are standard looking, nothing fancy but nice, clean, and comfy.  On the small side, but not clausterphobic or anything.   Elevators are a tad slow and old fashioned and check in can be a total nightmare since the hotel seems to be a hot spot for big tour groups, seniors, airline crews, etc.  There was always a line out the door to check-in and the entry way at the front is constantly jammed.  Even with long line, we checked in in about 20 minutes and the staff at the front counter were civil.     We will definitely stay here again because of convenience, price, cleanliness and ameneties.   Recommended!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2007-06-11	5	The Hacienda was a very nice hotel option for a weekend trip to LA. While not directly in the center of LA, touring the city was only a trip to the lobby away, via VIP Tours. Also, the location was close to the transit system, which was nice for a non-driving tourist, who is use to travling by public transportation. The only thing really missing from the standard room was a microwave and mini fridge. Overall a good stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2007-05-10	4	Great for travellers in/out of LAX which is just a couple of miles away - some airline crew ( cargo pilots )stay here which gives you an idea!     Adjacent restaurant is 24 hrs, and serves a good breakfast. Rental car returns for most major rental companies is just a few blocks away.  Hotel is on SEPULVIDA ( US1) which runs under LAX and then miles further north to close to downtown LA, and then from the hotel southwards almost in a straight line to Redonda Beach ( 7 miles) then westwards to Long Beach.........so you're well situated to start a journey and/or find the hotel at night!   Really no reason to stay here except that its practical, room is standard.........there's no free parking - you have to pay $5.00 a night to park across the street in the (hotel?) parking, and there was on several occasions a long line to check in/out........one or two persons at the desk and about fifteen waiting in line, with mounds of baggage.......know what I mean?	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2007-04-22	5	The Hacienda was very convenient to LAX.  The bed and pillows were so comfortable I slept great.

Hacienda Hotel		2007-04-19	5	This hotel has shuttle from the airport every 30min 24 hours a day, across the street are supermarkets and dinning options near by, when you go to this hotel ask for the south tower , the rooms are much better, it is a great choice for the money.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>
Hacienda Hotel		2007-04-12	1	It is old and in disrepair. . .the room itself is more like a one star.  The sheets had stains on them and the bed was hard as a rock with two small pillows.  The towel bar in the bath room was loose and fell on the floor when I put my towel back on it.  The anchors had come out of the sheet rock wall and it looked like it had been that way for awhile.  The attached soap dish on the bath tub was broken.  The bath room and the entire room looked like it had not been updated since the hotel was built (which looked like the 1950's).  The towels were the old, thin and skimpy type.  The room was probably fairly clean, it just gave you a creepy feeling like it was old and dirty.  Their free shuttle service to LAX was very good, which is about the only good thing I can say about this hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

Hacienda Hotel		2012-10-14	4	Despite to its closeness to the airport, its a quite hotel. The location is good which means that the good places like Beverly Hills, Hollywood or Venice Beach are reachable within 40 minutes by car. The parking spaces are not for free, you have to pay extra for it ($8/day), what is not fair because without a car in LA, you're lost. What they should improve is their elevator because it had sometimtes to wait 5 minutes for it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">525 N Sepulveda Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">El Segundo</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90245</span>

The only problem with the room was the noise level outside, possibly because we were there during Christmas time, which was just a bit above my comfort level. The gym equipment was somewhat dated, but my biggest issue was that the gym had no windows to the outside. Staff was friendly, and the concierge very helpful - she gave us a map of the area and some interesting places to visit and helped us with transportation questions. Also, we got there before the check-it time and they offered us a different (but equivalent) room so that we could check in early. Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-12-27	3	The hotel was an average hotel (stained carpets, old scratched mirrors) The Bed was VERY uncomfortable. The matress had waves in it , very worn, very old. -newline- Staff was very nice. But I upgraded the room due to free internet access and at the end of my stay I got charged 9.95 per night and was told all Orb itz customers do not get free internet service.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-11-19	5	My friend and I stayed in the Millennium Biltmore Hotel for a K-pop concert and we can honestly say we were not disappointed. First of all, two kpop groups we enjoy the most were staying there at the same time, it was filmed in a Korean drama I love and when we were leaving they were filming for an episode of Mad Men. That right there sold us on how popular it was. The service was friendly, helpful and very professional. The valet was a nice perk and so was getting the top floor. Our room was clean each time we went in and the hotel itself was gorgeous. We seriously loved it and we plan to us the same hotel when we go back again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-11-14	3	Since i've read a bunch of review before booking this hotel, it was pretty much what i was expecting. Glamorous lobby and bar, average rooms. The room was decently clean, but you can see the age; bathtub was very small and tight. other than that, it's just a regular hotel, probably not a 4 star, i would say 3.5. But we got a really good deal when booking the room, so it was worth it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-11-03	5	The hotel was fabulous, perfect, and was well beyond our expectations. There was filming going on, and it was great fun. -newline-  -newline- However, I urge you to NEVER use Dollar Car Rental as part of a hotel-car package. The Dollar system was by far the WORSR car retal experience we have ever had. Poorly run, very weak organization, and it took us over 90 minutes to rent a car and leave their lot.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-09-19	2	The hotel didn't have my reservation when I got there. I showed them the confirmation and they made me wait 15 minutes while it "loaded". The room was small and dark with sparse furnishings. I tried to open the shades to let light in, but the windows were so filthy that didn't work. The toilet was stained. The street noise was unbearable. Had to wait for the doorman to stop flirting with a housekeeper to get my car keys. -newline-  -newline- Downtown LA has no good hotels, so I guess that's why this place can be so mediocre and get any business. The location is good and the lobby is well preserved and historic.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-09-08	2	There is NO WAY this hotel is 4 stars! I was so disappointed! The hotel is old and in desperate need for renovation. -newline-  -newline- The lobby is beautiful, I would even give it 5 stars! However, the rooms are beyond bad, so I would rate the rooms at 2 stars. Maybe the hotel received its 4 star rating by taking the average of the 5 star lobby and the 2 star rooms. -newline-  -newline- The rooms are small, old, dusty, and nothing in them is upgraded. The bathroom tile is the cheapest small white tile (like in a public restroom). The shower is tiny and resembles a cheap motel shower. Even the toilet paper is of the cheapest thinnest and roughest kind. They don't even put brand new toilet paper rolls when you first get the room. Additionally, the sheets are not good. Instead of using a duvet - sheet for the comforter, they use regular sheets which don't cover the comforter well and your body basically touches a comforter which who knows how many people have slept in (the comforter also does not smell well). I was a bit disgusted from that experience. -newline-  -newline- Finally, some (not all) of the staff was unfriendly. At check-in, I was welcomed by a sassy receptionist - she was full of attitude. I would prefer to be welcomed with a smile and friendly demeanor. -newline-  -newline- I would not recommend staying at this hotel. It is not worth the price. It may be nice to visit for an event, check out the lobby and the restaurants, but don't stay in the rooms.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-09-05	5	This is the type of classic hotel everyone should experience at least once on a vacation. The vaulted ceilings and gilded hallways, as well as the gurgling fountain and crystal chandeliers bring to mind the great old hotels that hosted the truly talented artists from days gone by. -newline- The Millenium was our base as we explored the Los Angeles region. When we returned from Malibu, Universal Studios and other sightseeing venues, it was a delight to step into the Millenium's embrace. We especially enjoyed the Lounge with its complimentary breakfast and evening hor d'heurves. The wait staff was exceptional as was the concierge who helped us plan some of our excursions.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-08-29	4	The hotel is really pretty and photo worthy. You should walk around and enjoy the scenery and architecture too. The standard rooms were fine considering we only slept there and showered. My only thing are the shower heads though, but it seems like most hotels have the same issue. It seems like there is crusty white stuff on the shower head probably from not cleaning after the multiple uses. The rooms are a little used, but decent for sleeping and showering, so a 3.5-4 stars. There is a pool and exercise room, just ask someone there and they'll let you know where it is. There are towels and don't forget your room keys. We were charged $50 for incidentals because we told the front desk we do not want anything except to sleep and to void extra things such as WiFi. We also didn't eat there, but there are a lot of bus stops around that can easily take you anywhere, just use Google maps to determine the bus stop you need to where you want to go and it would be easier with a smart phone. The normal buses go for $1.50 and the DASH buses go for 50 cents. The staff were really nice, so no need to yell at them for your own problems (we've seen a number of people take their anger out on them, which I found completely unnecessary.) We walked around and went to store, the library (which I found so cool), lunch/dinner, etc. Nice hotel, decent room, good location and a nice stay if you can get it for a good price ahead of time.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-08-26	3	THE PUBLIC AREAS OF THIS HOTEL ARE MAGNIFICENT... THE RESTAURANTS, TEAROOM AND LOBBY ARE GREAT FOR SHORT TO MEDIUM LENGTH BUSINESS MEETINGS. -newline- THIS TIME I PAID TO STAY ON THE CLUB FLOOR. I INFORMED THE FRONT DESK THAT MY ROOM WAS MUSTY AND IT WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE REMOTE I HAD, TO TURN THE TV ON AND OFF. -newline- THEY DID NOT MANAGE TO RECTIFY EITHER OF THESE PROBLEMS; EVEN THOUGH I WAS TOLD TWICE IT WOULD BE DONE. FURTHERMORE, EVEN THOUGH I HAD SIGNIFICANT CHARGES AT CHECKOUT; WHEN I TOLD THE CASHIER THESE ISSUES WERE NEVER RESOLVED, I WAS NOT OFFERED ANY SAVINGS OFF MY EXPENDITURES. -newline- I THINK THETY CLEARLY NEED SOME HOUSEKEEPING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING, -newline- I WILL SY THE AMENITIES OF THE CLUB LOUNFGE WERE WELL WORTH THE DIFFERENCE IN PRICE.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-07-12	4	Absolutely stunning historic hotel. Comfortable. It is near metro station which makes it easy to get to places like Hollywood. I had a standard room. It was nice and comfortable but nothing really flashy. -newline-  -newline- Staff were very welcoming and helpful. -newline-  -newline- The Hotel is located in down town LA which is not meant to be the safest place. I walked around a bit but not much. Didn't feel uncomfortable but as a tourist you need to be a little street wise. I was there on the 4 July so it was pretty quite and there were lots of police especially at the metro station. -newline-  -newline- Word of warning. If you have a car it will cost you $40 per day.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-06-28	4	I attended an event at the Convention Center with a few family members and friends. I loved the staff hospitality as we did not know the city. Your inclusive snacks were great- definitely above average and appreciated at the end of a long day. My only disappointment was in the quality of the queen mattress we had. Too lumpy. Also the bathroom fans are weak and can't handle quick showers before become like a sauna! However, the beauty, history and location however is second to none!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-06-24	5	it was like going back a century but with all the modern amenities the room was really spacious, beds and bed linens of superb quality, quiet in spite of being in the middle of down-town L.A. -newline- I must say though the restaurants are not so inviting being always desserted and with very short working -newline- hours, but check the bottega loui on grand and 7th a real treat! form breakfast to late dinner!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-06-23	4	I recommend this hotel ONLY to travelers with a car. i didn't know that its location, downtown in LA is the most dangerous part of LA until i went out for a walk for a while in early evening. How could have i imagined that the area which has many beautiful buildings and expensive places is dangerous? Walking around this hotel is kind of risky adventure, so if you wanna stay here without a car, you'd better stay in the building, and move to other places by a taxi. but if you don't mind this dangerous street, just go out and enjoy the things around this hotel, becuz there are many fancy restaurants, bars, and cafes all over around. i strongly recommend to visit LA library and nearby cafe, it's beautiful. -newline-  -newline- Except for location, even if it didn't feel like 4-stars without the lobby and the exterior of hotel, everything was just fine and price-reasonable; i went there with REASONABLE price. Lobby was the most impressing part of this hotel becuz it was rly grand and looked like a historical constructure. The staffs were all very kind and helpful. However, it was little bit shocked that there was no fridge and abt 10 dollars internet was so slow.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-06-20	1	The hotel rooms are dirty, the staff was rude when asking for the room to be serviced and prepared appropriately.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-06-17	1	A staff stole my necklace from the 7th floor on the morning of June 16, 2013 between 9 - 11 am. Security has refused to share the list of people who have entered my room. I'm currently working with LAPD to see what can be done. I know there's little chance of getting the necklace back (it's a wedding gift with a lot of meaning) but I think it's important to get this on the record.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-06-10	4	The atmosphere of the Biltmore cannot be beat.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-06-08	3	We stayed at this hotel for what we thought was a relatively low price. However they get you with 40$ parking, and 10$ wifi. This I thought was just insane, I think they can let up at least 10$ or 20$ for parking and having to pay for wifi is kind of a joke. I understand they need to make money but I think they can let up on those prices. Other than that it was a pretty nice hotel, the room was nice and comfortable and the service was excellent.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-06-05	5	Just as there are many LAs, there are many ways to create or experience the LA of your choice, via your hotel stay. Passing on a motel that's generic, or a chi-chi modernist approach, the Biltmore was the way to go, to sample the elegance of a by gone era, where people dressed for dinner, and made a entrance, via a grand staircase! -newline-  -newline- But don't let the appearances fool you- the Biltmore is secured here in the 21st century, and has the gentle perks and amenities one expects from today's hotels, just quieter, more personal and with sincerity. -newline-  -newline- Location: you simply can't be the location for many reasons. It's very centrally located, especially since LA is a driving town. Pasadena. Santa Monica, Westwood- are really a short drive away. You are right next to the freeway system. But more importantly, you're at the heart of old LA with so many treasures in walking distance, under 10 minutes: Historic sites like Grand Central Market, Angel's Flight funicular, the LA Library and City Hall and the famed Bradbury Building (Blade Runner) are near by. The Toy, Jewelry and Fashion (Garment districts ) are 10 minutes away, a shoppers paradise of selection, culture and color. The Walt Disney Music Hall, MOCA and Olvera Street plus Union Station are also minutes way. If you have the need- Little Tokyo and Chinatown are about 15 minutes away. -newline-  -newline- You can park relatively inexpensively across the street from $6- 20 dollars if you have a rental car. -newline-  -newline- You want to Visit the POOL, Sauna and Stream room, check out the JAZZ downstairs and certainly bring your CAMERA to take pics inside the hotel- simply beautiful Beaux Arts stylings! -newline- And, i'll add the room is HUGE and was surprisingly Quiet- always appreciated! -newline-  -newline- the Only thing i wasn't thrilled by? No mini fridge and internet cost $9.95 per 24 hrs. Boo :(	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-05-30	4	The hotel is older, but very well kept. It was the suggested hotel from this site, and it was very nice, and seemed priced appropriately. Continental breakfast was great, parking is kind of an issue though. They valet it for $40/night which is excessive, but there is a garage across the street. Also, the location is great if you're there for business, but not so convenient for sight seeing.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-05-27	4	The hotel is incredibly beautiful, but is missing amenities that are now standard at most Motel 6 facilities. For example, the hotel charges for WiFi, has no honor bar or refrigerator in the room, and only has ice machines and pop machines on every other floor. It was a bit disconcerting, to say the least. -newline-  -newline- However, the staff was very polite and worked hard to be as helpful as possible.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-05-17	4	Wonderful architecture and preserved the feeling of the period. Surprised by high ceilings and size of rooms. -newline- I had an inward facing room that had a generator nearby - I couldn't see it but it was like a semi truck idling outside my room all night. I ran the air conditioner (also noticeable) to "tame" the other noise. I was only staying 2 nights so did not ask to be moved. Wonder though if it was my discounted rate that got me that room. The only other item to mention is the elevators are very small and be prepared to wait 3-5 minutes.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-05-15	4	The lobby was spectacular. It made me feel like I was in a 1920's movie. Bathroom was very dated but It goes with the charm of "old hollywood vibe". WORSE PART WAS THE $40.00 DAILY PARKING. If I would have known, I would have taken my $230.00 elsewhere. I ended up paying the "savings" on a daily parking rate. 5 days, $200 in parking fees is BOGUS AND INSULTING.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-05-13	4	The architecture is amazing! Be sure to check out the early 20th century tile pool in the basement of the hotel. It used to be a "gentleman's club!" and it reflects some wonderful examples of the artful California tile work of the 20's. " We could practically hear the ghosts of Hollywood's Golden Era toasting and boasting it up with each other wrapped in towels!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-05-13	1	Valet customer service and instructions needs a lot of work. Also, the rates are insane! $40 a night for valet is too steep. Internet access is $10 a night.

I recommend remodeling the bathrooms in the hotel rooms.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-05-12	4	Hotel was clean despite its age. Architecture was very interesting. Amenties were fine. Just wish internet was included.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-05-08	3	Located in the heart of downtown LA, this 1920's era hotel is extravagent in its public areas. The room was clean and comfortable, but needs updating. Tiny bathroom. Bathtub wouldn't drain, so filled while I showered. No hand towels or washcloths, only 2 bath towels. Very poor channel selection on TV. -newline-  -newline- But for downtown LA, the price was right.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-05-05	1	Requested late ck in and they terminated reservation.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-04-17	4	Comfortable, spacious, although the noise of the a/c fans outside the window of this interior room made a lot of "white" noise.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-02-15	3	The public spaces are classic "Los Angeles 1930's". If you enjoy that kind of nostalgia, the place is beautiful. Unfortunately, once you get to the room the charm fades. The housekeeping was very poor -- long dark hairs on the floor, in the bathtub and sink. Whether they came from the last guest or the housekeeping staff, they were disgusting. And for a standard room rate, I got a room overlooking nothing but an air shaft with noisy mechanical equipment at the bottom of it. The noise was so bad I had to go out and buy earplugs to be able to sleep at night. Overall, for the same amount of money you can find an LA hotel that is more comfortable and a better value.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-02-06	4	A friend and I stayed at the Millennium Biltmore for 2 nights and we really enjoyed our stay. The room was nice and clean and comfortable.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2013-01-17	3	Very tidy hotel. Very traditional. Some rooms have a closet safe some do not. Interior rooms - you do have to spend the entire time listening to aircondition units. Since i did not spend time during day inside, no problem. If that would bother you at night request outside with sun.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2012-09-09	4	The lobby, restaurants, and meeting rooms are beautiful...but be ready for a bit of a sparse room. All amenities were there, but the room was a bit small and very basic. -newline- Also, be ready for a $40 fee for your car, unless you want to pay each time you enter/exit the building. -newline- The entrance was very hard to find, it's small and not marked well. I had to drive around the block twice before I was able to pull in. -newline- On the positive side, the staff was very friendly and accommodating. The food was great in the restaurant. I would stay again in the future.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2012-09-04	4	My girlfriend and I decided to chose the Millennium Biltmore Hotel (MBH) as a romantic labor day weekend getaway. -newline-  -newline- Hotel Description: -newline- The MBH in the description was noted to be unique in the hotel market of downtown LA. It described it's amenities as first class and it's rooms as a perfect romantic getaway. The pictures included we beautiful as it showed it's rooms as picturesque. -newline-  -newline- Hotel Grounds: -newline- When we arrived at the MBH, I was taken away by the romantic style of the hotel. The high vaulted ceilings, the greeco/romanesque planes, and orate fixtures. As I walked around and I was very impressed with the hotel grounds. -newline-  -newline- Standard Room: -newline- When my girlfriend and I arrived at the room, I found that the description/picture of the room that was advertised was very different. Instead of a plush Napoleonic style bed, it was a standard king size and the room had an assortment of furniture, that seemed to be placed there for use. It that the hotel spent so much time with the physical attraction to the rest of the hotel, but left the standard rooms with spartan settings. The shower and bathroom was that of what I can find at a motel and I had trouble figuring out the settings on the shower dial. -newline-  -newline- Hotel Staff: -newline- Here is where I give the hotel top credit. The staff were very helpful in helping me find transportation, and would try to go above and beyond in helping guests out. For example, when I needed to find transportation and print tickets to Disneyland, the staff not only gave me great advice and produced maps of how to get there, they even printed out my tickets and told me of great deals to look out for. -newline-  -newline- Lastly, the hotel food, in both the restaurant and room service was excellent. The staff were were very observant and helpful. Although I wish I had time to sample their Afternoon Tea, from what I observed it was excellent. -newline-  -newline- Conclusion: -newline- Overall the hotel itself was pretty good. The staff, location, and price was excellent. My only gripe is that I wish they would upgrade the standard rooms to being more on par with the rest of the hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2012-08-28	1	I typically do not write reviews, however, due to the theft / hotel staff's feigned inability to find my iPad, iPod and associated charger, and a MacBook charger, I felt compelled to write this review. -newline-  -newline- I stayed at the Biltmore on the nights of the 21st and 22nd of August for work purposes. I was rushed as I was checking out on the 23rd and I mistakenly left those items charging on the floor next to the bed. I admit that leaving the items behind was my fault, however, in the past week, I have been repeatedly calling about these missing items and on multiple occasions, the security staff have acted as if they had never heard of my case, failed to return phone calls, claim that names of supervisors that I had been given do not actually work at the hotel, and in one call, put me on hold a minimum of 6 times in order to take calls from other people also complaining about missing items. Their security staff have done very little, if anything at all, to investigate the missing items when it is clear that someone from the cleaning or valet staff must have stolen my things. Usually, the Millennium chain of hotels is a respected and reputable chain. However, in my case, their staff have stolen close to $1000 worth of my property and the security and management staff have done little more than tell me that it is not in their lost and found. This is unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber and I urge you not to stay here if this is how the management treats its guests.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2012-08-02	3	Location Location Location - couldn't get better if you need to be in downtown LA. The lobby / the restaurants / the service is impeccable and you feel like a King walking in - until you reach your room. For a $250 - $300 plus per night hotel - the room was small / bathroom was small / iron was OLD / ironing board was stained / bathroom fixtures and shower were super OLD and cruddy. The bed was AWESOME though. I would pick a newer Marriott / Hilton in my next trip to LA.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2012-07-15	1	This hotel is horrible the staff was great in friendly , but the overall hotel itself HORRIBLE!!!!! I don't even write reviews but this I had to tell. First thing we checked in and our room was on the fourth floor as we were walking towards the room in I notice the carpet is burgundy with burgundy tape to match then we get to our room is basically in the dungeon no nice view or nothing so I call down in ask can our room be switched and they said yes. So I'm thinking ok this should be better by looking at the carpet in the new room on the third floor. But no it wasn't so once in the room we look around of course until I find a lifestyle (condom) behind the desk area then the remote batteries hadn't been changed in ages if ur looking for ammenties their aren't any the bath tub and the bathroom sink takes water forever to go down the hotel need to be updated it's still stuck in the 1920's I will never stay there again....	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2012-06-27	2	I stayed here once before and loved it I never had a single problem. This stay however was very different and I don't think I would like to return. The first night I was there I made sure as to check in early. This was because I knew I wasn't going to get back until late and wanted to go straight up to my room. I went up to my room to find out that the room was occupied by another person and the keys didn't work. I wasn't to mad so I went back to the lobby to advise the staff of the mistake. They insisted I had a guest there when I was traveling alone so I was weary. Finally after an hour of checking in for the second time, they made a mistake because the other guest had same last name as me. Thinking to my self the verified my name had my license and my credit card all with my full name and still made this mistake. Anyway I was very tired and not in the mood for arguing so I took the sencond room and went up to the hotel to sleep. The next day I went out earily and room service had fixed up my room. When I climbed into the bed to lay down as crazy as it sounds there was a razor blade in the bed. I was shocked I picked it up and put it on the end table next to the bed. I checked all around for where it could have come from and i could not find the source. My only explaination was that during cleaning it came from some equipment they used. Just be forwarnd about this hotel there service is very spotty to say the least.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The only this I liked about my room was the bed...of course the fact that my room window was facing a brick wall did not help matters. -newline-  -newline- The location is great if you plan to ride the bus/train during a visit because parking a vehicle here will cost you $40 a night which is a little ridiculous...decent hotel but there our much better ones in the area.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2012-04-30	1	If you value your car, do not stay here. There is no option to self park, valet parking only, (at exorbitant rates, btw). I've had trouble with valets damaging my vehicles in the past so I made sure to have the valet inspect the vehicle for damage before the car was parked and verify that it was in pristine condition. When I picked up my vehicle the next day, there was exterior damage to the door. I reported it immediately, filled out the appropriate forms before I left, and had the damage documented photographically. A week later I still had no response so I called the numbers on the forms. No one returned my calls. Finally, I received an email stating that -newline- their investigation into this matter yielded no evidence that they were negligent and thus, would deny my claim for damages. The car was in perfect condition when left with them, damaged when returned to me, but they deny responsibility. I imagine that this is probably a standard response in the industry. I don't intend to give up that easily though. I would speculate that their response would be the same if you had something stolen from your room or if you were injured at the hotel as a result of their negligence. This is an old, well known hotel, that I once respected. Well, they no longer have my respect and my advice to you is, AVOID THIS HOTEL. But, if you must stay here, DO NOT PARK YOUR CAR WITH THE VALET.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The noise from the street is like living next to a 24 hour construction site. The photos on the website definetely do not match the rooms offeres unless you upgrade from pressure from the front desk at check-in. Don't check in wearing casual clothing or the front desk personnel will treat you as a transcient!

We had never stayed in a hotel this nice and were surprised at what your money got us. The room was plenty big enough for my oversized scooter and the beds were soft and plush. From the doorman letting us in to the manager letting us make emergency repairs to the bartender why whipped up something special for me it was a experience. To top it all off we werer just minutes from Club Nokia where our concert was. It was outstanding.

I will stay here again on future trips.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-11-21	1	This beautiful and historic hotel has a gorgeous lobby and lower level meeting rooms, but once one enters the elevator and ascends to their room, the charm of yesteryear soon fades away. -newline-  -newline- I should have known I was in trouble when I left the elevator and found the corridor carpet was held together with red duct tape, but I kept my spirits high until I reached my room. Large but Spartan, the room could have still met my needs had it been in good repair. However, in my particular room, I had peeling paint on the bathroom walls, a tub that had chips and gouges to the enamel, a noisy and dirty heating unit and an absolutely disgusting old single service coffee pot. -newline-  -newline- When you add to this to the TV with a volume control that could not be turned lower than a preset volume, lack of free Wi-Fi in the room and no continental breakfast included with the room stay, I would have to say this was one of the worst hotel experiences I have had. If I were staying in some fleabag joint on the side of the highway, I would have expected such amenities, but what makes this all that more disappointing is that this was once the height of luxury. What a shame.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-11-19	4	Lobby and other common areas are exquisite, but my room was looking a little worn around the edges. Tears in the carpeting in the hallway were covered over with ugly tape.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-11-16	4	We've never been to L.A before and we could have stayed at a hotel near the airport, but we're glad we stayed at the The Millenium Biltmore Hotel which is near everything at a reasonable price. Across the street was the Pesrhing Station that took us to different attractions and restaurants. The only thing that my wife did not like was the costly use of the internet.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-11-15	3	The hotel was very nice and the staff were lovely. The room, however, was very tired. Not only did the curtains come off the wall upon trying to open them in the morning, but i swamped the bathroom when I took a shower. The showerhead was just as tired as the curtain rod and poured water in all directions, much like my sprinklers at home.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-10-18	4	The decorations of the public rooms and ballrooms at this historic downtown LA hotel are irreplaceable. And this is where the first several Academy Awards ceremonies were held. I have attended events here, but this is the first time I've stayed in a room. -newline-  -newline- Now, the place was built in the 1920s, and I was in the old wing, so it's understandable that it was showing its age in places (the hallway carpets were patched, for example), but the room itself was spacious. The elevators were quick. The mattress was new. And most important for me - it was quiet! -newline-  -newline- I happened to be there when they were having a guest cocktail event (trying to get us to sign up for a loyalty program), which was a pleasant surprise. The manager gave me some tips on restaurants. My encounters with staff were all professional. -newline-  -newline- You need a car in L.A., and the hotel is located a couple of blocks from the 6th Street freeway entrance that takes you in all directions. -newline-  -newline- Speaking of cars, the worst part for me was the $40 daily parking fee, which I learned about after arriving. But that seems standard in L.A., so I just had to accept it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-10-13	4	Location was good, room was clean. My problem was with how thin the walls were- there were so many complaints and banging on the walls because you could even hear people speaking in the next room. Other than that, it's a pretty hotel.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-09-09	4	It was a great experience to stay at this clasic hotel. I suggest to have beetter maintenance in the pool area, specially the jacussi, which was dirty and they used a wood board on a whole on a step to get to the jacussi. The sauna is in bad shape too.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-08-29	5	Durring my stay at the Biltmore, everthing was to our satisfaction. The rooms were always clean, there is a very nice bar by the lobby, a pool with a steam room and hot tub, and the staff was very helpful. Although above all, it has great location. You can navigate the subway easily, there are two stations by the hotel to get to wherever you want to go. Overall, great hotel and a great experience	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-08-29	4	My mother stayed here over the weekend and very much enjoyed her stay. She has some pretty high standards too! She thought it was pretty and charming, and found the staff to be very helpful. Indoor pool was great for her stay, as LA was in the middle of heatwave that weekend. She also enjoyed the tea room and restaurant.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-08-22	4	The Biltmore is classy and beautiful, but the rooms are old. Our room was a bit musty and the furnishings and trim were a bit dated.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-08-21	3	Let me start with the good. The Biltmore is a good, no, Great old hotel in terms of decor. The ceilings alone are worth a trip to see this grand old dame of Los Angeles. The mojitos in the bar were great. And my interactions with the staff were good as well. But... -newline- ...$9.95 for WiFi? Lots of places include it free or if they do charge you like Motel 6 it three bucks. Forty dollars for parking? Really? And then there's the renovation- apparently it's still going on because there was a paint cart in the hallway when we arrived. And much of what they've done is paint and no more, as in painting the old bathtub. Leave the old porcelain as is. That type of paint invariably peels and it looks worse than if you'd left it. It's like plastic surgery, you look younger, but never young. Let the patina of this gem shine. -newline- Would I stay again? Maybe.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-08-21	4	Experience was good. I had not been to this hotel in about 15 years - when it had been completely renovated. Was disappointed to see the carpeting in the hallways duct taped together and worn/dirty. Had the carpeting been in good shape the hotel would have been perfect.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-07-25	4	Grand lobby and historic area.  Bathrooms are old and windows are not sound proof to city traffic early in morning.  However, magnificient lobby and easy access offset some of the historic shortcomings.  Enjoyed the casual bar next to lobby as great place to meet and socialize.  For the price and high level of service, it is a good value.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-07-11	5	The venues & restuarants I visited were within walking distance. And, the weather was fit for a walkabout each day. Darn... i missed out on their exercise room. But i was just too tired each day. The hotel bed was very comfortable.. not too plush & not too hard. The front desk staff were informative and very helpful; basically they were outstanding. I'd definitely stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-06-22	4	The hotel was very elegant but the rooms were small. The resturaunts and room service was expediant but the food was not good or worth the cost. I called the hotel two days in advance to make sure of an early check in, smoking room and late check out. However, when I arrived my room was not ready and I had to wait an additional hour for a smoking room.  The staff was friendly and polite.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-05-23	4	Cool hotel.  Great decor. Rooms not as nice as rest of the hotel.  Felt a little shabby inside.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-05-16	3	Lobby and common areas fabulous.  Parking was $40 per day compared to $30/day at other downtown hotels.  No bathrobes, makeup mirrors, or glassware in rooms - unusual for a hotel in this caliber and price range.  Hotel service was very good none-the-less.  No shopping on nearby blocks.  I got my car in the garage but they ran out of room while I was staying there.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-05-12	4	The hotel lost my reservation and I had to wait half an hour to check in while I called your hotline to get help.The problem was fixed by your operator or agent and then they allowed me to check in.also the room was ok but the  bathroom needs to be updated and the bath tub had rust in it...eeks if I had been staying there for any additional days I would have requested to have my room changed.The Japanese dining at Issi was not very good.Also the parking is very expensive $40 dollars a day,but the safe was very professional and nice.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-05-04	4	Unfortunately my trip to LA was not for a happy occassion. There was death in the family. The Millenium Biltmore was not my first coice, but I do believe that it turned out to be the best choice. It is centrally located and there are many attractions that are accessible from it's location. The room was very comfortable and the Hotel itself is very eloquent. When I return to LA again the Millenium Biltmore will be my first choice.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-05-02	2	This is the hotel where was filmed Ghostbuster and I think since then it has never been renewed!! -newline- The hotel is old style, outside is beautiful, but the structure is old, the windows have no curtains so the early morning sun lights up the rooms. Rooms on the lower floors that have windows on the square are very noisy: we were in a room at 3rd floor so we asked the staff to change the room for the 2nd night. They did it and we could sleep again. The hotel staff was nice, but I can't recommend this hotel because I think it's time to renewal!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-04-23	4	i only stayed one night but all of the staff were very courteous and helpful. the lobby, bar, and lounge areas are gorgeous. my room had a single king bed but wasnt anything amazing. i did note that the air conditioning units were hidden, which is a good change from other hotels ive stayed in. the bathroom could have been cleaner (hard water buildup on the shower head), but the rooms are old and i'm a super neat freak. my only issue is that the hotel itself does not offer free parking or free wireless internet in room. even so, i would definitely stay here again	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-03-16	5	We just love the Biltmore. We arrived very tired and the receptionist was wonderful and put us in a room that was quite. We were very grateful.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-03-15	4	We've stayed at the Millennium several times and always enjoy the stay.  The last couple of times we have requested a room with a view and both times our request has been met with pleasure.  This visit, there was even a call to the room to make sure that we were satisfied.  Lovely.  There are many great restaurants within walking distance.  And, the bar is classic and comfortable...a welcome reward after a long day.  The historic hotel is a gem.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-03-07	4	Magnificent (some of the best I've seen) public spaces. Reeks of the elegance of another era. Gracious, friendly service. Room elegant, a little rough around the edges. Comfortable bed, nice pillows. Then there are the guests (does anyone dress in LA anymore?). I was offered a "quiet" or "noisy" (view but with traffic noise) room. Chose the "quiet" option which would have been the case except for the apparent legions of drunken, high decibel, revelers pounding up the hallways until after 3 AM. Perhaps Saturday nights do not show the Biltmore to best advantage. The bar is well worth the sobering cost of the booze although how anyone can get truly lit at those prices is beyond me. In sum,if you really don't mind sleepless bags under your eyes the Biltmore is worth every penny.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-02-26	2	This once elegant hotel sorely needs some attention. -newline- The rooms were poorly appointed, the windows dirty, the -newline- cupboards missing hardware.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-02-13	3	Thank goodness I got a packaged deal. I would have been disappointed otherwise. -newline-  -newline- 1) USD40 a day parking (or USD35 for self park across the street... not good for late night returns) that I didn't recall was included in the description -newline- 2) Valet service with a "minimum wage attitude" (they likely are paid min wage though) -newline- 3) Lackluster room... Tube TV (I've gotten cheaper rates in beverly hills with flatscreens), dated furniture with simple no frills bed, simple bathroom with plastic wrapped HoJo cups (yes, NO GLASS cups or mugs for the coffee maker). -newline- 4) Internet fee of 9.95$ per day	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-02-02	4	The Biltmore underwent a huge renovation in the early 1980s.  It appears that this was the last time it's been updated. The common areas in the lobby are lovely.  The carpet in the hallways is threadbare.  The TVs in the rooms are circa. 1982.  The room was immaculate. Bed was comfortable and bedding was nice. No convenient outlets to plug in power supplies.  Plastic cups instead of drinking glasses.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2011-01-10	4	Just stayed one night. No problems with my reservation or with the room (other than the mattress was too soft; the room was a good size).  Pretty good location in downtown LA - across the street from outdoor ice-skating (not year-round) and the Metro.  I ordered room service breakfast - on time and a great value for all that I got.  The Biltmore is a beautiful classic. I was especially pleased at the rate I got!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-12-28	1	This hotel is old, not taken care and somewhat dirty. Maybe it was nice at some point in time but not any longer. Service is extremely bad. We called the concierge (from our room) at least 4 times with no luck. We ended up walking down to the front desk and one of the front desk employees had to help us. He was very nice (the only one who could really provide any correct info). It seems that  besides this person (a dark skin very good looking man in his 30's) no one else could could  give you the right information. Where told (by one of the front desk employees as the concierge was never available) that the metro was good to ride, but in fact it was the worst. Homeless people call it home and you have to ride with them. We felt very unsafe at all times while staying there.  Simply, location is horrendous, specially if you  are in a vacation as we where. its far from all of the tourists attractions and its almost impossible if you dont have a car. Taxis are $25-$30 each way to where the action is. We could not wait for our 3 days to be over. Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-12-21	3	It looks like old Hollywood. The Valet is so great, they went out of their way. The rooms were a disappointment, however.

The rest of the hotel was really great.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-12-20	2	The Biltmore in many ways is a dream come true. Nestled in the heart of Down town Los Angeles, it is near the major districts of this city and with its interior masterpieces, it is no wonder this hotel is the home of many great movie scenes. And while all the glitz and glamor made this hotel a 4 star experience, the simple basics of hot water, electricity, etc were missing thusly making a motel 6 seem like a dream on a cold raining day. I do appreciate the beauty of this hotel, but the hot water was not working and on a raining day in LA, taking a cold shower is simply like standing on the street corner with arms opened wide. Will I stay at the biltmore again? Perhaps, but perhaps i will make sure to shower at the local gym first.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-11-22	4	My boyfriend and I stayed one night at the Biltmore Hotel for my birthday. [...] We are from Long Beach so we just needed a place to stay so we didn't have to drive. Upon arrival we were amazed at the interior of the hotel which was so ellegant. Three weddings were going on which were the most beautiful and I personally admire since thats my career path and for one hotel to be able to prepare for 3 weddings at once, thats wonderful. The service was great, friendly and fast check in. The bar opened at 4 right when we arrived and had some cocktails, on the pricey side but we expected that. We ended up at the bar at the end of the night as well with wonderful jazz music and delicious late night food. Overall was a great experience, however one down side...$40 to park your car over night for guests. I think thats a little ridiculous.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-11-09	5	What a gorgeous, historic hotel! We got a great deal on a spacious double room. Everything was clean and well maintained, the hotel staff was nice and helpful, and the cafe served wonderful food. The beds were also super comfortable. We would definitely stay again!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-11-08	3	Though the lobby and restaurants were very charming in their old-school glamour, the room was not.  The photos shown here are for 'concierge' upgraded rooms, not the regular-rate rooms.  They should be more clear about that.  It was a stark difference.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-10-18	4	we love this hotel. and our room this time was terrific. the only reason we don't give you 5 stars is that your concierge was not only unhelpful, but pretty clueless. better luck next time.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-10-14	4	The service was really good until we found out that we need to pay more for the extra bed and no one told us about this before when we booked the room. so they charged extra 30$ for the rolling bed. but in general, the hotel is nice but it's not the family type, more the business type.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-10-11	4	The hotel was/is beautiful...the room was a bit small and the hallways are too plain. but  very nice Hotel.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-08-31	5	This hotel is absolutely amazing! Sumptuous and luxurious in a true Hollywood style, with a lot of old-school movie star memorabilia, chandeliers and dramatic staircases, marble and painted ceiling. That's the place where Clark Gable got his Oscar, for they used to hold Oscar ceremonies here in the old days.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-08-26	4	Overall, it was a great experience. The only thing I did not like was the old style windows which let in a lot of street noise.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-08-21	4	Hotel has been beautifully restored and has a long history in the area.  Staff was very friendly and provided a good experience.  Caught a 72 hour special rate which made the experience even better.  The hotel is located at the beginning of Wilshire Blvd. and close to Hollywood and Beverly Hills 10-12 miles, but 25 - 30 minutes travel time.  Great live music on Friday and Sat. night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-08-10	4	It was pretty cool.  THE ROOM SERVICE IS RIDICULOUS!  $30 FOR A CHICKEN SANDWICH?!  REALLY?!  SIXTY DOLLARS FOR A HALF A CHICKEN?!  IS THE CHICKEN DIPPED IN GOLD?!  UTTERLY RIDICULOUS.  AFTER I WENT TO RALPH'S DOWN THE STREET AND PURCHASED A WHOLE CHICKEN FOR FOUR DOLLARS THEY GAVE ME THE RUN AROUND ON WHO TO TALK TO TO GET A PLATE AND SILVER WARE TO EAT IT ON AND WITH BUT OTHER THAN THAT MY STAY WAS EXCELLENT.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-08-02	4	The hotel was smack dab in the middle of downtown Los Angeles which makes it convenient to anywhere you want to be in downtown. -newline-  -newline- It is situated adjacent to the Historic Core if you are interested in discovering the way it was.  It is also next to the new downtown if more modern architecture is more your style. -newline-  -newline- It was great to explore the somewhat underground nightlife with many restaurants, theaters, bars, and clubs close by.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-07-27	4	Everyone was super nice and helpful.  The bartenders in the downstairs bar, were not as friendly and actual ragged on the front desk people for giving us "wrong information".  Actually the front desk did not give us wrong information, we were upgraded to the fancy bar upstairs, and the bartender just didn't want us to go up there.  Humph!!!  Otherwise had a great time!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-07-19	4	Beautiful historical landmark right in the heart of downtown in a quiet, safe neighborhood. Easy access to the subway, historical districts and downtown. Stayed here for our honeymoon and it was very romantic. -newline-  -newline- The room had a comically old TV with mediocre reception, but who goes on vacation to watch TV?  Woke up with a sore lower back every morning, but beds tend to wreak havoc on my back unless they're just right.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-07-10	4	Very nice old hotel. Rooms had been updated. Small bathroom though. VERY noisy! It is downtown so lots of street noise through the windows. If you are a heavy sleeper, it won't bother you. Great location to Dodger Stadium! Parking is expensive (right around 40/night), but there are a few overnight parking garages around that are cheaper!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-07-08	3	The hotel is elegant to the extent of its history but that's about it.  It's in a dire need of a renovation.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-06-21	4	Amazing time. Staff very friendly and helpful!! Were going to check in early but they told us if we waited a couple hours, we would get an amazing corner room. Best decision we ever made!!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-06-17	4	The rooms are huge but there was not much furniture in ours. Not really a problem, but it would have been nice to have a dresser or an extra chair since there's all that space. -newline-  -newline- The pool is warm and super-ornate. Beautiful, really. There's a sauna and a hot tub, and the whole thing is surrounded by the fitness center, separated by glass. -newline-  -newline- The only issue is that you'll have to walk through the lobby (and then down a series of hallways) to get to the pool. If there's a convention, prepare for lots of people to see you in swim wear! -newline-  -newline- Check in/out was seamless, and while the parking was expensive, the valet crew couldn't have been more efficient and nice. Plan an extra $40/night for parking.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-06-15	3	The room was not like in the picture. I have stayed at The Sofia Hotel and it was alot better looking. The beds are nice, have really good linen.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-06-14	3	This is a beautiful hotel, no doubt.  Of particular interest are the historic photographs and the gorgeous architecture.  Having a bathroom sink that would not drain is a disgusting inconvenience.  And finding out when you drive into the valet parking area that you will be paying $40 for one night's parking is not a pleasant surprise.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-06-13	4	The hotel is a deco palace, but getting into a room took an hour.  First, they had entered our reservation for the wrong date, and it took them 20 minutes and a manager to correct it.  Next, we went up to our room, only to find someone else already in the room!  The front desk took another 15 minutes to send someone up with keys to another room.  Really, a comedy of errors, but not very funny.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-06-10	5	There is nothing bad that I can say about The Biltmore!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-05-23	3	Disappointed to find out parking is $40 per night.  This wasn't mentioned in the reservation process.  And that internet access is $10 per day.  Restaurants are good but expensive.  Rooms are large, but bathroom is tiny and needs renovation.  Public areas are elegant, but the guest rooms feel old and tired.  Time for an upgrade project.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-05-23	3	Stayed 1 night.  The lobby is an incredible example of Art Deco in the grand Hollywood style.  The room, however, needs a little updating to keep up with the lobby.  The TV (tube style) was in armoire and made passage from bed to bathroom troublesome.  Bathroom had fairly new marble, but tub needed refinishing and the shower leaked.  Such a beautiful property...hope someone will care enough and have the resources to restore the rooms to original beauty.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-04-26	4	My 17yr old daughter & I stayed here to attend the symphony up the street at the DIsney Music Hall. Our stay was very nice, our room was nice and clean, beds were comfortable, the staff was very helpful. We asked for a taxi and [...] (the valet) asked us where we wanted to go and he sent us in the hotel town car instead and they picked us up when we were ready to come back a few hours later-- it was great!! Parking in the hotel lot is $40 a day, BUT directly across the street from the Olive Street entrance is a parking garage you can use and it's only $15.40 for overnight use-we parked there with no problems. Everything is close by, Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Hollywood, shopping--great location, I recommened it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-04-19	3	I liked the hotel very much, especially the design of interior. It was old but very elegant and luxury. -newline- The one thing I didn't like was their washroom. The washroom was really hard to use and very small. Overall, it was nice trip and nice travel package!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-04-07	4	IT WAS A GREAT LOCATION. WE NEEDED TO BE IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS THERE.  THE HOTEL WAS VERY ELEGANT LOOKING, BUT ONCE WE GOT INTO THE ROOM, THE BATHROOM FIXTURES REALLY MADE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE IN A PUBLIC RESTROOM.  THE BATHROOM/SHOWER COULD USE MUCH UPDATING. AND THE TV ALSO NEEDS TO BE UPDATED. THERE WAS NO MINI REFRIGERATOR. THERE WAS COMPLIMENTARY COFFEE THOUGH. WE JUST STAYED FOR A DAY, SO I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THE AMENITIES.  THE ONE THING THAT WE DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT THE HOTEL OVERALL IS THE $40/DAY VALET FEE! I WISH I CHECKED FOR THAT BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE PROBABLY BEEN THE DEAL BREAKER TO STAY AT THIS HOTEL.  SINCE IT WAS ONLY A DAY, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, BUT FOR SOMEONE STAYING MORE THAN A DAY, I'D RECONSIDER THIS PLACE.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-02-28	2	Friendly staff...

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-02-21	4	The service was excellent.  They upgraded our room at check-in with a simple ask.  The hotel is in an excellent location and the place itself is a historical landmark.  Beautiful and classic decor.  My only (small) complaint is that the hotel looks a little worn in the halls and rooms.  Very clean though.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-02-06	4	It was our first anniversary and when I told the man at check in we got up-graded which was awesome! The room was lovely and delightfully old-fashioned which I wanted. The view was great as well. Bed not so comfy, but the room service food was fantastic, best eggs benedict ever. Also the free breakfast on the club floor was really lovely. My husband loved the coffee and wouldn't stop mentioning it. Whole staff was super friendly!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-01-19	4	Wonderfully restored California lnadmark. Large comfortable room with great bed. But $40.00 for the privilege of parking your car is more than a bit onerous. The Valets were very efficient and courteous, and for that price they surely should be.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-01-14	4	We had a great time at the bar and a wonderful breakfast the next day. We were only there less than 24 hours, but a great weekend get away.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2010-01-10	4	The ground floors of this hotel are a jewel or architecture.  I parked my car at a public lot across the street for only $10.  Why stay in a modern, non-descript hotel for $85 when you can enjoy looking at places used in hundreds of movies and TV shows ?	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-12-15	4	My son and I visited here this past June 2009 and it was a delightful experience.  We didn't have a car but the subway was right across the street so we were able to go back and forth on it to our destinations.  The only complaint that I have is that the windows in the rooms aren't double pane and so there was a rather noisy generator going all night outside the room.  Other than that the hotel is breathtaking.  The staff members, for the most part, are very friendly and helpful.  There was maybe one that was a bit snooty when we checked in.  Also, the beds sleep like a dream!  Very comfortable.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-10-14	4	Gorgeous elegant classic hotel but without the "tired feeling".  The lobby, bar, hallway, restaurant and bar were all very elegant.  While I was there, film crews were filming scenes for the TV show Castle.  The setting seemed perfect. -newline-  -newline- The rooms were elegant but a little bit outdated with small TVs in cabinets. -newline-  -newline- I chose this hotel instead of a "preferred" hotel for a recent convention that I attended and was glad I made the choice.  It was nicer and also significantly less expensive.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-09-24	4	Our trip was for a "Bible Crusade" in downtown LA and was 1/2 mile from hotel and the courtesy limo took us over and picked us up twice a day with no wait. We had many meal choices in the local area. The only thing we missed was no place to eat in hotel at 5pm. Everything opens at 6PM. -newline- We wanted a refrigerator for the room and they brought one up quickly and a light out that was repair immediately as well. Staff was great to us and we would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in LA.We travel a lot and this was a pleasant stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-09-10	4	Hotel lobby was amazing and top notch, so was our bedroom which had an amazing view of downtown. I would've given this hotel five stars but I had one issue that upset me during my stay. -newline- The hotel staff will not notify you about the parking situation because they are hoping you'll use the valet service which costs $40 a day. We assumed that the valet was included in the hotel price, but later found out by the additional charge on our bill. The concierge finally told us about the cheap parking a block away at checkout. -newline- Other than the parking issue it was a fine hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-09-09	4	I told the front desk to make sure the room we were staying at was quiet but at 3am the people next to us were so loud coming down the hall and extremely loud next to us...I swear it sounded like there was 10 of them in the room. I couldn't go back to sleep right after that.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-09-02	4	This is a grand hotel which can be enjoyed in many different ways depending on budget. Simply walking the lobby and halls is great. Bar is superb. -newline-  -newline- There is a closed courtyard for smoking that is secure and on ground level a short distance from the lounge. The spectacular gift boutique features hi-grade cigars by the way.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-08-31	4	We really enjoyed our stay here.  It is a beautiful hotel with an interesting part in the history of Hollywood. -newline-  -newline- The staff was very nice and helpful as we didn't really know our way around.  The (indoor) pool is awesome with a Turkish bath feel to it, but fairly small and not meant for children playing around really (tiling around the pool gets really slippery).  Our room was OK, but not necessarily living up to the aesthetic of the lobby (it felt a bit dated, but very clean). -newline-  -newline- All in all it was a great stay- would definitely go back or recommend to a friend!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-08-23	4	Great downtown location.  Large room, although it was sparse on furniture.  We moved a round side table from the side of the room so that we both had bedside tables. It's an old hotel but still maintained well.  Valet parking was expensive($40)but with free in-and-out, and very prompt retrieval service, it was still a good deal. (Especially considering the great rate we got with Orbitz.)  Room service breakfast was served at the time requested, and was very good. -newline-  -newline- We booked two rooms and both couples were very happy with the stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-08-10	4	The overall experience was nice.  After a long/noisy night at a concert nearby we were hungry.  Tried to order room service at 12:00 am off the "Late Night" room service menu.  The operator informed us that "Room Service closed at 11:00 PM".  I offered a friendly suggestion of removing the Late Night Room Service Menu from the hotel information book to receive "is their anything else you need" from the other end of the phone.  Hmmm!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-07-05	5	The Biltmore Hotel was a much nicer Hotel that I thought it would be. The staff was very friendly and had no problems with anything. I stayed with a friend to attend a convention. Only thing I had a problem was the location. Not much to do around the hotel, have to walk a bit to get to anything nice. The price was about half the cost of any other Hotel around the convention center. I would stay again and recommend this spot for anyone else that wants a nice cheap Hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-06-29	3	It is an old hotel and the rooms aren't modern.  The location was convenient for the purpose of my visit.  The lobby, halls and ballrooms are impressive.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-06-29	1	PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE! -newline-  -newline- First and foremost parking is $40 a night, even if you are staying at the hotel, and it took 45 minutes for the valet to pull my car out front. -newline-  -newline- I made a reservation for this hotel because it had a very good price (of $100 a night).  I was suppose to stay Friday night and Saturday, however there was a change to my business meetings and I had to come in on Thursday.  The rate for Thursday, however changed, and I was charged $220.  When I asked to talk to a manager about this price jump they told me that I would receive parking for free as a gift.  Figuring I had no other choice, I regretfully accepted. -newline-  -newline- Their mood was very different upon arrival because I was still charged $40 for parking and when I told them I was suppose to receive it for free the manager laughed in my face (literally, which was one of the rudest experiences of my life). -newline-  -newline- Secondly, I had a late meeting Friday night and came home around 12:30, and wanted to order from their "24 hour" room service.  But sometimes when they are slow, they decide to let their staff go early and close down their room service without notice.  I hadn't eaten since lunch and asked what I could do, which I got a response of "There's a Taco Bell and a Subway about a mile away."  I then asked if I could pre-order breakfast to my room so I could just go to bed and have it there when I wake, and she told me that "was against hotel policy."  I then called down the front desk and asked if I could use the hotel car to take me to a late night deli to get a bite to eat and was told that again "was against hotel policy" and was told again that there is a 24 hour Subway about a mile from the hotel!!! -newline-  -newline- They literally wanted me to walk alone in a strange downtown at 1 am to get food!  And they call this a 4 star hotel?!!?!?!?! -newline-  -newline- PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-06-29	4	when I was at the hotel  we used the pool once. really cmfortable beds but we didn't recieve the club room we booked online. when we tried to upgrade they told us to wait a day so we did and when we tried again they told us they couldn't get us one. extremely upset about that because we paid extra a night  to get a nicer room. tried to order room service one night because it said it was open from 10pm-6am, we called down there and they said it was closed when it shouldn't have been. was a nice hotel but overall was just ok, staff was kind of rude and didn't get ideally what we wanted.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-06-20	4	Well located for downtown stays. Didnt utilise many facilities but the room service experience was very good. Room basic and a bit unusual but comfortable and functional.  Small bathroom with an over bath shower. Lobby and public areas were a very grand step back in time.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-06-17	3	Hotel check-in was a breeze.  Didn't like the price of valet at the hotel, considering there are definitely cheaper options within walking distance of the hotel. -newline-  -newline- Upon entering the room, it was dark and no light switches were on the wall.  I had to crack open the door to let some hallway light in to find the closest lamp.  The room was lit up strictly by lamps.  No free Wi-Fi; it costs $10, I'm glad I brought my Wi-Fi card. -newline-  -newline- But for the historical background of the hotel, friendly staff, and decent location I would stay again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-06-16	4	I really enjoyed my stay at the Biltmore. I work at a fashion market in downtown LA so it is very conveniently located to where I need to be for work.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-06-13	5	The hotel is beautiful, the service was superb, the bar and restaurant were elegant with good food and nice selection of wine and drinks.  A first class experience all the way.  Probably the best downtown hotel I've ever experienced.  The staff in particular is warm, attentive, and went out of their way to be helpful in big and small ways.  Only complaint:  parking and internet are expensive.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-06-09	3	I waited 2 hours at time of checking in.I had to call Orbitz to try to fix the problem.My reservation was not made.At time of checking out same situation the hotel gave me a bill for my staying.I had to contact Orbitz again. The hotel stuff was rude.  They said that was my problem because I used a  third party to reserve the room. I was very disappointed in the way the hotel stuff handled the situation. Orbits never send my paperwork for my reservation to  the hotel.I do not understand why I had a confirmation number,my card was charged and the reservation was not there upon my arrival.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-06-09	3	I enjoyed my hotel stay. The rooms were clean and the staff was very nice. The valet parking was a bit expensive and the room upgrade was also expensive since our upgrade room was surprisingly small. We stayed on the club level 10 where there was a club lounge. The "complimentary" drinks consisted of cheap wine. The "continental" breakfast consisted of fruit and danishes.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-05-19	3	The public areas are beautiful, the staff is friendly but it is way too noisy to get a goodnight sleep.  The room was big but the windows are single pane and I could hear the MTA buses putter up the hill on 5th Street.  Parking is $40 but I paid 13.20 across the street in Pershing Square.  I got a better nite sleep 2 weeks prior at a Motel 6 in Auburn, CA that was next to a freeway than at this prestigious and more expensive hotel.  It was quite disappointing.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-05-02	5	The history of the hotel is worth the stay, we were only there 2 nights but thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-04-22	4	The hotel is a historic landmark and absolutely beautiful so that was worth the experience alone.  The parking was $40 per day (ugh!) but you can use the Olive Street lot for $6.50 (weekends) a day! The maid also left a different set of towels everyday and the TV was from the 90's!  The best thing about the room...the bed!!! Loved it!!!!!!!!!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-04-22	4	The MB made our stay worthwhile.  The receptionist(s) were very helpful and took the time to recommend a few places to eat. -newline-  -newline- The hotel is close to the highway(s), sports arena(s), and arts district.  The weekends bring a large number of wedding ceremonies and the week days smaller conventions; in short there is always something going on around you. -newline-  -newline- Though the lobby, pool, and bar were all amazing, the rooms are showing there age.  If you are not planning on camping in your room your whole stay then the BM is an excellent choice.  Parking is a downer; be sure to to take advantage of the local parking decks if you plan on parking your car for several days.  If you plan on being in and out you may need to suck it up and pay for the valet; as you are not charged for re-entry.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-04-22	3	Worth the visit as the common areas are gorgeous and decadently ornate. Nice bar with nice bartender who actually took pleasure in mixing a cocktail (old fashion, brandy alexander) Stuffy desk crew but air of first class expected. Pool is classic art deco with exquisite tiles. History hall with photos of past glory. down side is parking is grossly expensive $40/day , but valets were very nice and attentive. We came to LA after 3 nights in Vegas at the Palazzo - so the the older, small rooms, tiny TV was "different" and sparse. But room was very clean and quiet and bed was comfortable.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2009-04-22	5	Adult daughters and I off on 4 day vaca from NY. Parking garage across from hotel was cheaper for parking. First night we walked into hotel to find a filming going on- A Tribute to Nat King Cole. The next 2 days the filming of a scene from the TV show"Heroes".  How cool is that!!!  Asked for a larger corner room and was given that without any problems. Didn't realize it meant alot of traffic noise early in AM. I wanted to stay here for the historical and elegant beauty of this Grand Hotel.  It met all my expectations and more.(look for the corridor with all the photos taken of Hollywood Stars and Famous industry people).  Getting to all the tours and attractions was a simple on and off of the Freeway.  A GPS comes in so handy .  Parking was a breeze in downtown L.A.  Check out the Farmers market, Hollywood walk of Fame, Grauman's Chinese Theatre, We went to the Bonnie Hunt Show taping and we saw ourselves the next Monday on TV.  The IVY Restaurant was nothing special and very pricey.  The Tour of Hollywood by open Van was fun and informative. A short ride to Venice beach and Santa Monica Pier for an afternoon was great.   I thought L.A. was so much cleaner than the streets of NYC.  First time there and we all loved every minute of it!!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-12-19	5	The Millenium Biltmore is a grand dame of hotels. Not only is it beautiful, it's also spacious, well apointed, and welcoming.

This was the second time I stayed at the Biltmore, and it won't be the last.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-09-05	5	The Los Angles Biltmore is an elegant, historic hotel with beautiful lobby (vaulted ceilings, dark woods etc) but rooms have recent remodel.    The room was large with a table/chairs, love seat, 2nd chair and two double beds and lots of open space. Usual tv, hair dryers etc     Food in the tea room is amazing with excellent service.   The hotel is located in downtown Los Angles within 3 blocks of the Contempory Museum, Disney Concert Hall, and Opera. Resturants and bar in the hotel are beautiful and very lively. Staff in all areas are very attentive. Enjoyed my stay and will stay there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-09-01	5	We stayed two nights. Everything was awesome. The only negative was the parking! $40.00 a day! So we parked around the corner for 6.60 for the day and over night was 13 something.. def worth it.       Downtown area, not to shabby.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-09-01	5	The Biltmore was a great place to stay, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful at all times, this made our stay much better and pleasant.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-08-21	5	The Biltome is a charming hotel located in downtown Los Angeles. The location is alright, within walking distance of many amenities but as in many other office city centers, downtown LA dies out after dusk. The room was spacious and clean, even though the general look was faded. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. The gym was a fairly good fitness room with several aerobic and weight-lifting machines (although there were very few free weights). The parking fee (valet only) was pricey, $40 per night (parking lots nearby offer daily fees of $5-12).	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-07-19	4	The Millenium Biltmore Hotel, Los Angeles stands as an historic, elegant, wonderful property in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. On first inspection the property appears in very good condition with much of it's original architectural elements preserved and maintained. The staff from parking valets to doormen to the front desk staff were friendly but reserved; almost business-like, could have been warmer in their greeting. The king room was pleasant, well furnished and comfortable but bathroom grout could have been cleaner. Unfortunately did not have a chance to sample any of the food or beverage. The parking charge for in-house guests of $40.00/day is outrageous and probably the reason I wouldn't stay at this property again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-07-12	5	The Biltmore Hotel lives up to its expectations.  Large clean room with a built in desk and cabinets.  Has 1 lounge chair with several floor lamps.  Beds are very comfortable with one nightable.  The bathroom rather small but comes with plenty of towels.   Midnight snacks are delicious.  One has to try the guacamole and salsa dip.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-05-28	5	The Millennium Biltmore is located one block from the subway and is also convenient to major freeways. Hollywood is a short subway ride away. A quick drive gets you to Universal Studios. All the major attractions of LA area easily accessible.       The room I stayed in was remarkably roomy. When I made special requests they were fulfilled seemingly before I could put the phone down. Indeed, service at the Biltmore is consistently quick, friendly, and accurate. In short, if you like superb service; large, comfortable rooms; and an unbeatable location in a gorgeous Italian Renaissance hotel with an illustrious history (it's the original home of the Oscars) then the Millennium Biltmore is just what you're looking for.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-02-24	4	The Millenium Biltmore is a historic hotel with a wonderful ambience. The rooms were pretty standard, and the bathrooms were nice and spacious. However the view left much to be desired. My overall stay was very satisfing. The staff was helpful and friendly and the room service was the best. I would stay at the Biltmore again and would also recommended it to others.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-02-20	4	While the following did not affect me, I was surprised that the area to the elevator was up two steps and was not handicapped access (i.e. no ramp).      Secondly, the parking in the hotel cost $40 a night, but I learned that immediately around the hotel were secured indoor lots which cost $10-$15 per night.  Over the course of a four or five day stay, especially when one is not always using his car, that can add up to a lot of extra money for nothing.      It also was surprised that the doorman rarely bother to open the doors to the hotel, often leaving guests (I among them on one or two occasions) to struggle with luggage and packages.      Finally, I was in a room where the sink basin in the bathroom was cracked, and there was a large blackened, enamel-stripped area by the drain in the tub.      The common areas of the hotel (e.g. the lobby) were stunningly beautiful, in the hotel is quite convenient for those with business in downtown LA.  All amenities (e.g. dining, gym) were upscale, and the Biltmore, of course, is one of the great historic buildings in LA.      As one might expect, the front desk staff was cognenial and helpful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-02-17	5	The Millennium Biltmore is a beautiful hotel with very grand baroque/art deco proportions. Truly one of the sights to be seen in L.A. all by itself. Great amenties, indoor pool is not too be missed, good restaurants in house, lovely lobby bar with live jazz in the evenings. I stayed in a standard double room, while on the smallish side it was very comfortable. Lots of closet space. Great Bellman. Not much goes on in  downtown in the evening but the hotel is very convenient to other parts of towm eg. Hollywood, West Hollywood, Melrose Beverly Hills.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-02-10	5	The Biltmore was recommended to me by friends and lived up every expectation.  It is a beautiful hotel that is wonderfully opulent in design.  The rooms were well appointed and comfortable; the staff friendly and helpful.  It was fun to stay in this hotel that reminds one of the glamour of the early 20th century. Sadly there is not enough of interest yet in downtown LA. It was hard to find a place to eat at 8;00 PM on Friday except at the hotel. Be prepared to make full use of the efficient valet parking!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2008-01-26	5	The Millenium Biltmore was gorgeous!  The rooms had a very historic feel to them, the beds were comfy and the room service burger was the best Ive ever had!

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-11-26	5	Staying at the Biltmore is a historic and amazingly pleasant experience! One can see its greatness in every little detail.      The rooms are very large and comfortable.      Everything about the hotel is just perfect, but I would like to make a special reference to the breakfast, where you can order eggs with truffles and a glass of champaign, and to the Gallery Bar, with perfectly prepared drinks by nice bartenders and a wonderful atmosphere.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-10-01	2	The Millenium Biltmore was a disappointment.      Not a really welcoming stay.  I asked to be moved away from a large rooftop air conditioner, so they put me in a smaller, darker room.  Air conditioning in the room was noisy.  Only one restaurant operating on Sundays--and it was just OK.  Architecture of the place is wonderful.  But overall comfort mediocre.  Wouldn't stay there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-09-26	2	The rooms are dingy, old, and not clean.  There was mildew in the bathroom, dustballs around the outlets, and a general worn look in the room.    As a business traveler, I expected wireless internet in my room.  The wired connection in my room didn't work and I was forced to use the business center which charged me $45 for about an hour!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-09-16	5	The Millenium Biltmore has great decor and reminiscent of the old grand hotels. The public spaces are wonderfully decorated, but the rooms are relatively small more reminiscent of hotel rooms in Europe.  The restaurants are expensive,even the informal cafe.  I recommend Sai Sai, a wonderful Asian Fusion restaurant. Not many other choices outside the hotel for eating on weekends, as downtown closes up.   I found the level of service very good, and the people at the front desk helpful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-09-08	4	This is an amazing hotel property.    As you enter and walk through the main areas you can clearly see that this was once the best hotel in LA.          The Hotel Staff was friendly and the location was central to both business and pleasure.      The management of the hotel have done a good job, but they will need to try a little harder to make this a sought after destination.        The good news for them is that they are almost there.          Areas for improvement are almost all limited to the passage ways from the grand main areas to your room.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-08-19	3	The check-in was great.. the people were very nice and very helpful!! But I was uncomfortable with the room I received! It was dark, not enough lighting. There was no vanity area. but overall it was a good nite stay!!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-08-19	2	The Millennium Biltmore was nicely decorated.  The hotel room itself was very small but it was nicely decorated and most importantly clean. The hotel bar was a nice, lively lounge.  The location was good (not a bad area) but we found the hotel seemed farther away from touristy attractions than expected.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-08-16	5	We stayed three nights at the Millennium Biltmore and were very satisfied with the room. The hotel staff was very friendly and correct. The hotel has an impressive reception hall with a luxury feel.       The room we had was on the ninth floor and offered a nice view on Pershing Square. The room was relatively spacy, the beds were very good, the bathroom had all we wanted.      The only backdraw was the 32 USD a night valet parking fee. The hotel in in downtown LA, but close to highway 1010 which connects to the 10 and the 101. To Hollywood or to Santa Monica by car takes about 20 to 25 minutes which we thought wasn't a big deal.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-08-05	4	The Hotel is a beautiful property located in downtown L.A.  Our choice was based on proximity to Dodger Stadium, less than 3 miles away.  The one-way streets can complicate the drive but get a good map!  The room was large and very clean.  The A/C was more than adequate but was a bit noisy.  It is a old property and the bathrooms are a bit dated.  Our biggest complaint - the shower curtain blows into the shower and sticks to you while showering.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-08-01	5	The Millenium Biltmore was excellant value for money. The staff service was excellant but I am disappointed in the lack of full internet service by it not having an smtp acount so that i could send out emails. I would have expected a hotel of this level to have a better internet and wireless system. I found the room very clean and neat if a little worn around the edges due to its age. The public areas were outstanding along with the resturants.     The location was easily accessable to the hiway and to the downtown area.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-07-30	5	The Millenium Biltmore is a step back into the guilded age of Hollywood, but has modern ammenities.  We especially enjoyed the luxurious and opulent architecture in the public areas and learning about the history of the hotel.  They used to hold the Oscars there!  Although not opulent, our room was large and the bed was comfortable.  We enjoyed the restaurant.  The food was excellent and the staff attentive.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-07-30	5	The hotel itself was very majestic, we felt like we stepped into another world.  The most fun was all the filming going on around the hotel everyday.  We saw scenes from CSI:NY, a brand new feature film, Ugly Betty, and a commercial being shot all within two blocks of the hotel. Each day we wondered what we would see next. Also very convenient to the hotel, was the underground metro (many people do not realize that one exists).  We rode it directly to Hollywood, where we saw the Kodak theater, Grauman's Chinese Theater, the Hollywood walk of fame, shopping and lots of fun souvenier shops.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-07-24	5	The Biltmore has a sort of old LA vibe in the new Downtown area, where there are new bars and restaurants opening, it seems. One person told me Downtown is getting kind of hip. Its quieter than staying on Sunset or in Hollywood, but close to the MOCA, the Metro and even Silver Lake isn't far. The hotel rooms aren't huge, but have some old details, crown molding, etc... All is very clean and quiet. The lobby is  kind of    incredible and enormous. Various ornate bars to have cocktail in, walls lined with old photographs of actors from the 30s and 40s at the beginning of the Academy Awards Ceremony era. The gym is suitable, yet small. The pool is indoor, but clean and well kept. Excellent restaurants right in the hotel, though they are somewhat pricey. Cheaper fare, and things like a Starbucks, are right down the street. Recommended for those that want to try something different than the usual Sunset strip stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-07-23	5	I thought the hotel for the most part was a nice hotel to stay in for the location and convenience of travel into other regions of Los Angeles.  I did think that the parking was over-priced since there are no other options to park.  The bathroom in the room was extremely small and barely left enough room to open the door properly.  The pool and spa area was terribly out dated and needed some attention given to restoration of the jacuzzi, and dry sauna areas.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-07-23	4	The hotel was very historic and beautiful.  We stayed in a jr. suite and had plenty of room.  The club lounge was very nice.  Appetizers were great and the conciege was wonderful.  She suggested a location for dinner, made reservations, and we were shocked when we received an appetizer from the concierge at dinner.           We celebrated our anniversary and loved the historic look of the building.  There isn't a variety of dining options in the hotel, however the bar downstairs did make very good mixed drinks.        The club lounge offered been and wine.  The staff in the lounge was quick to refill our beverage and clear any plates.  We were suprised in the morning to have hot eggs and bacon provided.      Overall, I would stay again.  I was pleased.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-07-22	5	Since it is a piece of art and historic LA landmark, I thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. I choose not to eat, use the business center, nor park in the hotel becuase it is very, very expensive.     However, I would recommend this hotel to anyone because of its great location, and the building per se, complete in art deco.     There are many wonderful sites nearby which totally promote downtown Los Angeles, so it is very centrally located.  When I checked in on a Thursday afternoon I immediatey walked about 20 blocks checking out the entire nearby area and was quite impressed.  The evening was further interesting because there was a musical group playing in Pershing Park just behind the hotel gratis of the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Summer Concert Series.     The most ridiculous cost in the hotel was the rental of a computer in the business center to check one's e-mail at .49 per minute. This tells me major hotels in major cities strive to make money on every single amenity they offer.      Anyway, I loved the hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-07-16	3	The Biltmore is a beautiful old art deco hotel. takes you back in time to the glamor of Hollywood. Great resaurants and the staff and service is very good. The room itself however had lots of room for improvement. For one, the entire floor seemed to be smoking floor and our room smelled of old stale cigars and cigarettes. The cleanliness was not so wonderful either. The bathtub needed better cleaning and in the middle of the night a bug landed on me! We were also situated above the airconditioning for either the hotel or another building and that was very loud. But the Arcitecture is amazing! So incredible. This hotel would be wonderful with some updates and no more smoking!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-07-14	4	My door key never worked the entire time I stayed there.  However, every time I was locked out of my room, a staff member promptly met me outside my room to open it for me.  Also, when I entered my room for the first time, my bathroom was flooded because of the toilet leaking.  Again, it was promptly attended to by the staff.  The people at the front desk were wonderful and very friendly.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-07-05	5	The history here was excellent. Vintage hotel with ghosts of past movie acedemy awards. Very Luxurious and comfortable. I can fell the past in the pictures on the walls of actors who stayed there. Built in 1923 but the rooms were outstanding. I would do this again in a heart beat.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-06-27	2	The Millennium Biltmore is regal in appearance, very ornate and historical.  However, the rooms are not well kept, exhibiting tread bare draperies, bedspreads, and shower curtains.  I would not stay here again until and unless the place receives a complete interior update.  Its best feature is its location downtown, which is convenient for business purposes.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-06-24	4	The Millenium Biltmore was probably a very nice, grand hotel in the 20's. Today, however, it is very run down, the rooms are small and dingy, and there wasn't even a mini-bar in the room. That meant that if we wanted a bottle of water or a soda, we had to trek all over the (huge) hotel to find something.  The restaurants offered a broad selection of food, but it was over-priced and not that well prepared.       The location (Downtown Los Angeles) required that we drive everywhere, which took at least an hour no matter where we went, thanks to LA traffic.       I would NOT stay at this hotel again, it is a horrible value for the money and in a very inconvenient location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-05-20	4	It was my first time in LA and was very pleased with my visit.  My only complaint?was the mattress - it was not too comfortable.

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-05-17	2	I paid 10$ for the Internet everyday and I could never access wireless although they told me they had wireless.      The parking cost me 32$ a day and only valet parking is available which means probably you'd pay more for tips.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-05-15	1	The Millenium Biltmore Hotel was not such as good experience than i hoped it would be. It seemed like that the staff did not know a lot about their job. That evening I asked the concierge if he could expain me how to get to a specific club, which he couldn't. Therefore I requested if he could look it up on the internet. Again, i would expect a concierge to do so without asking him.       The room was very small, and it seemed like it hasn't been renovated for a long time. I also could see dry blood on the carpet, which I thought was very ugly.      Room service was ok, thery brought the food pretty quickly and warm.       My friend paid for the room service and the parking $112, when we checked out. Unfortunalty at the next day we could see on her account statement, that the hotel has charged $460 instead of $112. I beieve that the front office agent should have noticed that they have charged too much at the end of her/his shift, which he/she hasn't. Therefore we had to call the hotel and sort things out. The worst of all is, that nobody felt responsible nor did anyone apologise for what happened.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-04-30	5	I remember visiting the Biltmore as a child. Soaring ceilings, fountains, murals, fresh flowers in the lobby, gracious staff...It was convenient being located downtown near the City of the Angels Cathedral, Disney Concert Hall, MoMA and plenty of restaurants.       The hallways and common spaces are beautifully appointed and my room was lovely.       The only downside is that with the beautiful weather in Los Angeles there are no grounds, no tennis courts, no outdoor swimming pools or outdoor spaces to relax and have a drink.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-04-29	4	The price of this hotel is great, but the location isn't good for tourists.  Also, the front desk workers were rude.

Otherwise, it's a pretty good deal, but not a great location for tourists.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-04-26	4	The hotel lobby is beautiful and the location is good if you need to be downtown.  The price was great for the area.  The rooms weren't great.  There is no refrigerator.  The hairdryer was about 20 years old and took forever to dry my hair.  The staff is certainly not overly friendly or helpful.  For the price and location, it was a good deal though.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-04-23	4	The public areas of the Biltmore are spectacular and do indeed evoke an earlier era of LA glamour. The room while clean was not at all as inspiring as the public areas of the hotel and the TV set was a joke.... The bathroom was very clean as well as VERY small. It was still worth the stay in order to be able to catch a glimpse of what was once considered one of the premiere hotels of LA. The location was perfect for anyone who wants to see downtown LA and be able to walk to various venues.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-04-21	4	The Millennium Biltmore Hotel,in LOS ANGELES, CA   is in downtown LA but has easy in/out access to the freeways. The room was excellent with a pleasant desk/work area plus plenty of lamps for needed lighting. The lobby areas are beautiful and they, along with one of the door entrances, have been used in films. The only negative point was the ineptness of the concierge as we asked for help, directions, etc.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Millennium Biltmore Hotel		2007-04-13	4	We enjoy staying at the Millenium Biltmore.  It is undeniably the real deal, architecturally grand and lovingly restored.  I don't mind the size of the small guest rooms (typical of historic hotels), but the bedding and furnishings are beginning to show signs of wear.  Also, the bathrooms could use a cabinet for toiletries and storage.  I would characterize the lobby and general areas of the hotel as 5-star, but the guest rooms are 3-star.  However, the excellent on-site restaurants and friendly, helpful staff more than make up for these minor complaints.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">506 South Grand Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2014-03-24	4	Amenities was average, most of the stuff there were overpriced. -newline-  -newline- I was not happy about paying $35.00 for parking (Note: People will have to pay $35.00 a night for valet parking and you can have in and out privileges. BUT if you use another parking spot to park the car yourself, then you will have to pay $20.00 a night with NO in and out privileges SMH THAT'S CRAZY! -newline-  -newline- Had my 19yr old daughter with me. She could not go upstairs to see the swimming pool because she had to be 21 and over. I saw what the pool looked like on the website and did not read that someone had to be 21 and over to go to the pool at night.. That was another thing I was unhappy about! -newline-  -newline- The temp in the room was cold. Just know that the temp in the building will not succeed the temp outside. It will always be cooler in the room/building. That was another thing I wasn't happy about. -newline-  -newline- Felt better when I was changed to a room that was a little warmer. -newline-  -newline- I honestly would not stay at this hotel again. Too expensive and it is as if they only cater / care about people who like to party. I don't believe they care about people who have family that stay there as the rooms itself are made for "couples".	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2014-02-18	2	Decided to stay here valentines day. Thought this would be a good idea because it had resturant and roof top bar on premise. Upon arriving is my biggest gripe. Valet said it would be $35 or we could self park for $10. We werent being cheap we just didnt have much luggage and weren't planning on leaving anywhere so we decided to self park. When we tried we were told the lot was full and would have to valet. So i then self parked my car in valet and they said I would still be charged the $35. I didnt feel like arguing. At the check -in desk the attendant asked how our night was going and we told him our story. He then said very smugly "yeah its $35. No empathy from anyone here. We then went to the resturant which turned the night around. The fod was suprisingly very good and the waitress was amazing. I expected the basic room to be small and it was, but it could have used a good dusting. All in all I didnt see the value in staying here.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2014-01-28	3	Perfect spot downtown for the young and hip. Hotel provides the perfect locale for roof top partying and close access to downtown venues. Rooms are very basic and while comparable to others in the area, overpriced based on room qualities. Bar noise travels very easily and even the free earplugs won't stop it from allowing a good night's sleep. The basic queen was roomy enough. I wouldn't pay more for a few more inches.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2014-01-21	3	We used it only as a place to sleep one night. Supposedly they had upgraded us to a "nicer, larger room" but it was on the 2nd floor and the disco misic reverberated in the room until 2 a.m. Rooms and lobby are decorated in ultra modern but are not user-friendly. Bed on a platform was difficult for us older folks to get out of. Hotel's free wifi sucks. Wouldn't stay again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-12-11	3	It was a nice hotel with clean rooms and the roof top was beautiful! It was my birthday and the staff was nice enough to give me 2 drinks on them.

The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-12-01	5	had a smoking room top floor with a brilliant view....open and very comfortable bed....compared to what i have paid 120 $ at other places the extra 80$ for the night here was well worth it.....WELL worth it. its a trendy spot with hipsters and a more party theme so if your looking for like a relax spot id say no otherwise it was bang on	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-11-15	4	Had a great experience. Staff at front desk was nice/attentive. Room service food was very good, reasonably priced. Rooms were kitschy but cool. Rooftop pool/bar was unique. Could hear loud music in room at night (assume it was coming from roof), but in this hotel, it's almost expected (and they provide ear plugs). Not a hotel to bring kids!! -newline-  -newline- Only complaint was the free wi-fi; it was spotty and I couldn't stream video without lots of annoying hiccups and it kept freezing some sites I use for work on my phone -- I ended up just turning off my mobile wi-fi -- worked much better (they offered a $9.95 upgrade, but in my mind if you offer free wi-fi, make it quality or just don't offer it). -newline-  -newline- All in all, it was a great stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-10-20	4	We are an older couple, so while a stall shower is best, the fact of being in a glass rectangle with no grab bars or slip prevention flooring created stress. We had to ask for a second chair. And a raised bed on a platform is dangerous for us old folks. But we knew it was a hotel for the young, so we managed. But if you are over 55, you might want accommodations elsewhere. -newline- The best gift was Caffee Primo down the street. Reasonable and delicious!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-09-24	4	As soon as we arrived, we knew that it was one hipster hotel that accommodates to the younger crowd. That is what we expected and hoped for anyway, so it worked out. The staff was fantastic and courteous, the room was clean and organized, etc. Some complain that this place is not as nice as priced, but it is downtown Los Angeles after all. Overall, good experience, not amazing.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-09-03	3	The location could simply not be improved upon in downtown Los Angeles. It is near good shopping, etc. -newline-  -newline- The room itself was attractive, but "trendy" in an way not designed for comfort. The bed was a mattress and box springs on a 4 inch platform rather than a bed frame, so I would "roll out of bed" as standing up was odd. There was only a single, unpadded plastic chair in the room, which was inadequate. The television is a rather small one. The elevator was S-L-O-W and a problem. On the other hand, the staff was superb and the restaurant was open 24 hours. The valet parking service was able to get my car in less than one minute (repeatedly) which is much, much better than having to call 30 minutes prior to leaving and then just hoping that it is ready when you need it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-07-28	4	The roof top at The Standard was so beautiful. Great view/atmosphere/pool. The rooms were ok. The shower is in the room with only glass separating the shower from the room. This is a problem if you are staying with family and want privacy. Kind of inconvenient. But I will return to the roof top for sure. The food is really good too!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-06-21	3	It was an updated older hotel with fabulous rooftop bar and pool. While my mojito was a little expensive, overallit was a good experience, nice staff including housekeeping. I did try to order breakfast in the room when I got stuck doing work, but the line was busy for 20 minutes. I called the front desk and the girl in a flat monotone kept saying "line's busy hold" every 30 seconds. Perhaps there should be a larger kitchen staff or at least a system in which they call you back. Ended up going to a cafe an hour later.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-05-07	3	I hate that they had a "bouncer" to get into the room elevators. Everyone had to check in to get into my room. Sometimes I had to go down and get them. What's the point of getting a large room if you can't have people in it. It was like getting into a night club, it was ridiculous. The rooms are cool looking and modern, but that kinda dampered my night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2012-04-27	4	The hotel experience was fine. My issues were with the website I booked the room with. their name has to do with what a planet does around the sun. I booked this room for an employee and provided a corporate Credit card to pay for the room. When my employee tried to check in he was told there was a problem with the card and he ended up having to use his personal card in order to check in. Very unprofessional folks. Don't bother with the discount.

The Standard, Downtown LA		2011-11-01	3	I stayed at The Standard Downtown LA on the last day of our trip out to LA. We were within walking distance (2 to 3 blocks) of a grocery store, coffee shop, LA Live, and the freeway was very easy to get to by car. The staff was nice and the rooms were small but comfortable enough for 2 people. The hotel lobby and restaurant were serviceable and I would definitely visit the rooftop bar for a drink if I'm in the area again. I was disappointed with 2 of the amenities in the rooms.... 1. the TV stand was too low to the ground and so it was uncomfortable watching the TV from the bed. 2. internet was free but the wireless connection from the room was very bad so I could not get any work done during my stay. But overall, considering the price and the location (downtown LA not Hollywood, Bev Hills, or Santa Monica), I would definitely consider staying there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2011-10-26	5	Standard is a great hotel. It lives up to the hype. Very private and quiet rooms. Great bed and high quality sheets! Very clean rooms and bathrooms. Room lighting is flexible: you can make it dim, sexy, moody or focused. Room service is priced a bit high though but the staff and service was excellent. If you want to save some money park your car a few blocks away from the hotel there are better deals for parking than the standard parking lot (rip off). Also there is a Famima (its like a 7-11) a block or two away open 24 hours. The neighborhood is safe to walk around.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2011-09-22	4	Service and staff was great. Caters to mostly younger generation, I'm 62. But thats okay, young crowds are good. Television sits too low to the floor.

The Standard, Downtown LA		2011-05-31	3	Yes, the decor is hip and the rooftop bar is fun if you're into that scene.  BUT the service is by far the worst I've experienced at any hotel.  No one helped us with our bags as we lugged them from the parking lot through crowds of drunk bar goers to the front desk to check in.  There was no courtesy parking during the checkin as in most hotels.  Housekeeping was problematic every day.  One day they did not come at all.  On the other days, soaps, towels and glasses were never replaced.  When these items were requested, they took hours to come and staff were unapologetic. -newline-  -newline- Still, the hotel is right near the metro, has free wifi, and has it's own club scene which is nice.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2011-03-21	5	A friend of mine and I stayed at this hotel for the excellent prices and prime location for the LA Marathon. It was a great experience! The valet were super friendly and they were anticipating my arrival. Walking into the hotel, I got the impression that the hotel was a lounge you'd find at an upscale bar or club. Checking in was easy and their theme is cute with the "Hello! My name is ..." cards. The room was cozy and cute. The shower was a glass case for the rest of the room to see. The bed was very comfortable. I have no complaints and the service was excellent! I would definitely stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Also you are given a key at check in for the mini bar in your room.  Once you unlock the fridge you are charged $2.20 for simply opening it.  Ridiculous charges like that are BS.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Had to request bathing robes twice - why can't they just replace the old ones every day? -newline-  -newline- Rooftop was said to be the new go-to place in downtown, but after reading through a few Yelp reviews, decided not to because it was over-priced. -newline-  -newline- Distance to Universal Studios or K-town was fairly close, so that was good - it took 30 minutes to get to Santa Monica, so that wasn't that bad.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-12-27	1	Having stayed in hotels in 36 countries, I would say that I am a world traveler. With that said, you can take it from me that this is not where you want to stay. An example would be coming back to the room after a lunch appointment and finding that the 1 glass that was left for me had a huge crack in it. I didnt complain, but instead used the glass because I was in a hurry to make a few calls before I had my next appointment. The next day when I arrived back in the room, the bed was made, but the glass was still sitting where I had left it, and there were no towels. -newline- That was what it was- I didnt complain. However, when a friend who lives in LA came to the hotel to visit, the worst experience of my travels was about to happen. My friend brought homemade ice cream, but didnt bring any spoons. So, rather than calling House Keeping for a couple of spoons, I went down to the Front Desk.  I waited there for close to 45 minutes while one person after another was helped. Everyone who came to that desk AFTER me was helped, but the Front Desk person would not help me, but kept looking at me to make sure I caught on that he was aware that I was there, but he wasnt going to help me. -newline- I spoke with the Manager the next day about this, and was informed "No, he wouldnt do that. He is a great guy."  Well he did do that. He deliberately insulted me, and for no reason at all- I was dressed well, had my room key in hand, and was all smiles talking to my friend while we waited.  Thus I must delcare that he wasnt helping me because I am white, or because I am gay, or because my friend there with me is Hispanic. Either way, there is no excuse for it.  We all have our bad days, but that doesnt make it ok to be just down right rude to people. -newline- Therefore, I am going to tell it like it is- no more nice guy for them- As far as ammenities, there is a tacky gym in the middle of the building- thus, no windows, but it has the nicest wood paneling from the 60's if you care to workout in a wood box. -newline- At check in, the staff is very proud to inform you that you get 2 passes to the the roof top deck every night- Which I found that is when it becomes a hip hop club that brings in people that you will eventually see on the evening news.  The club is hoppin all night, but dont worry if you cant make it up to the deck, you can hear the music and the people all the way down to your room- ALL NIGHT. -newline- I could continue with the horrors of my stay here, but will leave it at this: -newline- Dont lower yourself to their "Standard"	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

I'd suggest this place to any hip person who wants to have an amazing time in Downtown LA and the other surrounding cities!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-10-21	2	Location is close to everything downtown and very convenient to the 7th Street Metro Station subway.  For the price, I would have expected at least a coffee pot in the room and a pillow that didn't deflate.  Also, I booked a king-bed room since that was all that was availalbe, but what I didn't know was that two entire walls of the bathroom were glass!  I was traveling with my mother so we had to take turns leaving the room so that the other could shower.  The boiler broke on the first day so we were both left to take a cold shower.  When we called the Front Desk, they did comp 2 of our room service meals, but only did so upon request. -newline- The hotel is hip and cool.. the design is interesting and very European, but in trying to be different, it just lacked too many "standards" of hotel travel in the U.S.  I would not go back unless significant improvements were made or the price dropped way down.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-09-23	5	Initially a little intimidating but only because we were jet lagged! But after gaining sleep were more and more impressed by facilities and the location. Polite and helpful staff and the place oozes coolness without even trying. If you bring an open mind you can enjoy an almost sublime experience. -newline- We were on the 10th floor and noise from above was simply not an issue! Awesome experience and would definitely stay again. Heated pool rocks!!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-06-15	4	In June 2010 we stayed five nights at The Standard in downtown LA and enjoyed our visit very much. The staff were always very friendly and helpful, and our room, [...], was spacious, impressively decorated, and kept very clean. Although we are seniors, we thoroughly enjoyed the young vibe on the weekend at The Standard. Also, we liked very much this hotel's central downtown location. We easily walked to places and events in the downtown area.I would stay there again and would recommend The Standard to other travelers.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-05-16	2	I've been there several times with coworkers for Happy Hour on their rooftop bar which is fun and has an awesome view of Los Angeles, so I thought it would be a fabulous place to stay...NOT SO!!!! -newline-  -newline- THE ROOMS ARE INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND DISGUSTING!  It seems like the hotel was going for a contemporary look which was compromised of inexpensive nouveau furniture and the bed mattress was 6 inches off the floor on a mattress box.  You may as well sleep on the ground.  It also seemed quite disgusting that the sheets and comforter were tucked under the mattress and landed on top of the box where people can step on since the box extends beyond the width of the mattress. -newline-  -newline- The bathroom had its issues as well.  The bathroom looked like a gym locker room that hadn't been cleaned and had no room for my toiletries.  I felt like I needed to have my shoes on the entire time. The faucet water smelled like a sewer and the scent from complimentary bar soap made me nauseous. -newline-  -newline- Don't bother getting room service here either because the food was not very tasty.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-05-16	1	Honestly I was shocked and appalled at the rooms at the Standard.  The hotel rooms are akin to what I would imagine staying in a Motel 6 would be like.  They have a mattress on a platform--no real comfortable bed with an army blanket on top no comforter.  The room is extremely sparse with cheap plastic chair and table.  The shower is completely see through so if you are a family or staying with friends you probably do not want someone watching or in the room while you take a shower.  Privacy anyone?  The pool area is cool but the lounge chairs are ridiculously uncomfortable.  I would NEVER stay at the Standard again and I highly highly caution you from staying there.  The only thing the Standard is worth is the party at night.  Do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else and party there.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-05-10	5	Funky hotel.  Great food.  Central location. -newline-  -newline- Service, however, was skin deep...  Staff were very friendly, but not necessarily wanting to take responsibility... -newline-  -newline- The phone in my room didn't work properly: it didn't ring and messages vaporised into thin air.  No-one came to look at it, and it probably still doesn't work.  The operator just "put a note on her system" - it worked, but I wouldn't want to rely on it... -newline-  -newline- I had an issue at checkout, being charged US$6.75 each for 5 or 6 cartons of water which were not listed on the mini-bar price list and I had assumed they were complimentary.  After some argument they were taken off the bill, and a further reduction was made as a goodwill gesture. -newline-  -newline- The food really was outstanding for an American hotel.  The coffee (even the espresso), however, was as awful as anywhere in the US.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-04-27	1	When we got there the Valet was nice...when we got to the front desk the hotel staff ruined the whole 2 minute experience so far by their rudeness and unprofessional actions. not one time do they look at you nor answer your question untill you ask atleast twice.... i ignored that and me n my friend both checlked in along with my other friend checking in to his room... we had 3 rooms there oh and they messed up on my room too.... right before we were going to the club, the Female security/lady that gives wrist bands was completely rude and started yelling so we were rude back and she basically refused to let the birthday person up to the rooftop along with his 3 friends. BUT, we had given them business of over 30 people already paid and waiting for us upstairs! so we talked to the manager and yet, he was completely unprofessional and rude....he would videotape us when we spoke our minds and not record himself when he is cursing or being completely unprofessional/"tough"....he did not allow us up and or nor ANYTHING! so the birthday boy spent it in his room and the 30 plus people waited for him for nothing upstairs! alll because of the UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF! I would love a refund for everything and am gunna take this a lot further!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-04-16	3	since  the holtel was located closed to  where i was supposed to work during my trip, it was kinda convenient to move. -newline- other than that.  i didn't really enjoyed it. -newline- maybe  i could have stayed  much nicer hotel with the price. -newline- overall the hotel looks old  but  seemed that  they  tried to look  hip. yes  the  roof top lounge was kinda cool  but  that's the only thing  i liked. -newline- room was small  and not comfortable at all. -newline- the restaurant in the lobby  was  ok. you can try.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-04-04	4	Went to LA for class reunion at the superior university in Los Angeles, which is closer to downtown than Westwood.  Standard is close to some of the newer hot spots.  Bottega Louie, LA Live, etc.  The hotel building has great history and the outdoor dining area is great for an urban setting.  Only negative on the trip was that key to my room was given to someone else who checked in later.  At about 2am, this person tried to get into the room. Luckily we had put the security bar on the door, otherwise this would have been ugly.  Hotel comp'd parking to make up for it.  All in, this was a good property and you get access to the rooftop bar, which is still happening.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-01-17	3	My boyfriend and I statyed in this hotel two nights while we enjoyed exploring the city and Hollywood.  The location was great but for the price we paid I wasn't impressed with the room at all.  Our room was very small, only had a bed that laid directly on the floor, and the shower was completely glass and in the middle of the room.  Therefore, none of your bathroomly duties were private.  We didn't have a coffee maker or cups, or really anything extra.  Everything extra was an extra charge to your account.  The hotel roof was amazing though.  It had a pool and bar but we both still felt out of place.  If your not made of money or use to being pampered on, then this is not the place for you.  We never left our room unless we were leaving the hotel.  It doesn't have that friendly inviting vibe to just wonder around and do as you please.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2010-01-06	5	Always a great place to celebrate in the heart of downtown with fellow partygoers rather than families and business people.  Hotel staff is decent, but this time, it was better as they were friendly (most of the time they're not).   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2009-10-07	5	My coworkers and I stayed while attending an event at the Convention Center.  I arrived around 9am and I was welcomed but two very friendly staff members and I was able to check in to my room straight away.  Very hip and trendy indeed and almost retro.  After the event and long day we spent the evening at one of the coolest spots in Downtown, on the ROOF!  The lounge was amazing with the mixed atomosphere, fireplace and water beds next to the pool!  We had an amazing time and for a reasonable price.  I will recommend the Standard Downtown LA to all of my friends.  Rooms were great, beds were incredibly comfortable and the bubble bath in the oversized tub similar to the size of a single bed, next to the window was quite memorable.  The Mini Bar and supplies were fun to check out too!  Thank you for a fabulous weekend.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2009-09-28	3	I have known of The Standard for quite some time having lived across the street from it for 5 years.  The hotel's attraction is its edge, atmosphere, unusual rooms and rooftop pool/bar which is used for filming in many TV commercials these days.  One of these attractions is usually enough to make the experience worthwhile and it was this time. -newline-  -newline- The hotel's negatives are lackadaisical and sometimes aloof staff (front desk these time), the slow bell/valet service/front desk at peak times, and noise in the hallways as post-bar disrespectful people go to their rooms and sometimes decide to hang out in the hall and post-party as they did during this stay.  At checkout time the bell person never appeared to my room after 40 minutes (and 1 reminder call) so I carted my stuff downstairs to the check out desk.  The line was prohibitively long with only two desk staff working at a peak time, so I had to bypass check out and call their accounting office two days later in order to get my bill faxed to me. (The first time I called, the person in accounting never called back so I called a second time the next day and got someone live). -newline-  -newline- Valet car retrieval was slow. It took about 20 minutes with only 3 other people in line in front of me. -newline-  -newline- This is the good and the bad with The Standard that I've known for quite a while. Perhaps some things just won't change there.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2009-09-19	3	I came to LA,California to treat my father to four baseball games to see the LA Dodgers play at Dodger Stadium.  As soon as I walked in the Standard Hotel Room, I immediately felt uncomfortable because the shower, (which seemed to be the focal point of the room) was surrounded by glass and it had no curtain for privacy. One of us had to leave the room when the other one had to shower, which was ridiculous.  The Hotel was gloomy and dark. This atmosphere is perfect for the younger crowd (college bound or young newlyweds).  A plus was that the rooms were clean and the employees were friendly.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2009-09-14	4	Overall, it was a pretty good hotel, great location and friendly staff. The only thing I feel unsatisfied is that the person who clean our rooms did not give us brand new lotion, conditioner, soap etc. every night. I don't know if it is an individual problem or the hotel's policy. Personally, I prefer more than less, or just enough.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2009-09-08	5	Had guest only access to the pool, a cool atmosphere, awesome valet service.  Called for a towel late at night (noticed the cleaning staff didn't put out two) and it was brought up with no problem or delay!  Would recommend strongly.  I did not dine here and so rated it neutral.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2009-08-18	5	Not for children but great location, close to everything. The lobby is beautiful and they have live bands. The staff was very accommodating. The roof top is a wonderful idea. You can swim, chill, or party all on the roof. The bathroom is HUGE which is great for sharing a space. -newline-  -newline- You can party in the hotel either on the roof of lobby and safely walk back to your room. Drinking and driving is a nonissue. -newline-  -newline- One night we had a noise problem, however the hotel took care of it immediately with no questions asked.  I would most certainly stay there again. I also would like to check out this hotel in other cities.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2009-08-01	1	I've stayed here many times.  All too often, there are a number of people on the staff that are too snotty and elitist.  And they have a bunch of rules, like you can't take your backpack to the pool.  The location and the patrons are cool.  The staff is composed of jerks.  Stay at your own risk.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2009-06-02	4	While they didn't have the correct information about my stay (they thought it was for 5 nights, instead of the 6 I had booked), I was quickly upgraded to another room and booked for my entire stay. -newline-  -newline- I was there for conference at Convention Center - the hotel is 2 minute walk to Metro station and about a 20 minute walk to Convention/Staples Center.  Not a ton of dining/nightlife options in this part of town, though (although there is some very good sushi nearby).  It has a small, but clean and functional gym (interesting photos, ahem), a restaurant and bars on site.  There was an odor of cigarette smoke over the weekend (from the Friday/Saturday night crowd, I think), but there were no traces of it a couple of days later.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

I went for dinner and arrived at the hotel around 11:30 on a Thursday.  There was a line to get in and they were not letting people into the bar to control the crowd.  I showed my key and got myself and a couple friends in with no questions asked.  They definitely take care of thier guests.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-10-11	4	Nicely renovated and trendy hotel in downtown. The best thing about it - the bar on the rooftop - is maybe also the reason why some people might complain about a bit of noise at night. For us it was perfect though. We loved the design of the room including the see-through bathroom. We did get charched around $40 for overnight parking though, that seems a bit unreasonable, especially because the valet staff was very unhelpful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
The Standard, Downtown LA		2013-08-07	3	Wir haben zwei Uebernachtungen im Standard Downtown LA gebucht. Gefreut hatten wir uns vor allem auf den sch√∂nen Pool mit toller Aussicht auf dem Hoteldach. Leider sind unsere Kinder, 15 und 17 j√§hrig zu jung f√ºr die Poolparty, welche jeden Abend auch dem Dach stattfindet. Dies war allerdings bei der Buchung nirgends ersichtlich. Wir wurden vom Personal auf dem Dach sehr unfreundlich abgewiesen. Das Zimmer war sauber, die Betten sehr weich, Frotiert√ºcher konnten wir ohne Probleme nachbestellen, es waren jeweils nur zwei Sets vorhanden. Gerne h√§tten wir einen Wasserkocher auf dem Zimmer gehabt. Der K√ºhlschrank war mit √ºberteuerten Artikeln des Hotels √ºberf√ºllt, so dass wir keine eigenen Getr√§nke k√ºhlen konnten. Schade, dass das sch√∂ne "Nichtraucherzimmer" sehr stark verraucht war. Zum Personal an der Reception: Danke, ihr seid sehr hilfsbereit und freundlich. Ihr macht euren Job ausgezeichnet. -newline- Wir w√ºrden dieses Hotel nicht mehr buchen, weil wir mit 45 Jahren zu den √§ltesten G√§sten geh√∂ren. Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr gut, Metro in der N√§he, Restaurants und Cafe ebenfalls. -newline- F√ºr junge Leute ab 21 Jahren, welche eine trendige Unterkunft suchen, ist das Hotel ideal.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">550 South Flower at 6th Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2013-11-30	4	We stayed at this Hotel for 3 nights. The room and the bathroom were very comfortable and luxurious too. The balcony faced the pool and direct sunrise everyday, which was a delight to watch. -newline- The only con was that there was no coffee maker, you had to request for it. -newline- Recommendation is- if you want to experience luxury, then it's a thumbs up.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2013-05-23	4	The hotel was aesthetically appealing. Customer service was generally good. Room was nice and comfortable. Live band at the hotel bar at night was really fun. Hotel location is ideal, right across the street from a very appealing outdoor mall and movie theater off of Sunset Strip. Outdoor swinging hammocks and multiple pools and hot tubs were an additional treat. Complimentary fresh flowers for my room put a big smile on my face.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2013-04-14	5	We loved the hotel room, the facility and some of the staff.

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2012-12-06	2	Just send a Fedex overnight morning package to guest at the hotel. Fedex showed delivery time at 8:51. Guest called twice. At 11am, front desk still said there is no package.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2012-12-06	2	After traveled for 20 hours on a plane, my relatives found out that the hotel had sold their room to somebody else even though they prepaid for 11 nights. They were sent to a hotel 5 minutes away and had to repack then returned the next day. Hotel provided taxi vouchers which no taxi drivers were willing to accept. Hyatt Regency front desk had to pay cash to get the driver to take us instead of waiting any longer, The bell captain at the other hotel had to spend10 minutes to convince another cab to take me back to Hyatt Regency. Why sign up with a taxi company that will not accept them? Don't tell me that we are the first guests who had these experience. It only meant that your hotel is not up to the standard to offer excellent service to your guest. When we checked in, there were other guests who got the same problem. So that means you must have oversold a lot! As a matter of fact, the other guest said that he would never returned. Even the cab driver learned of our story said that your hotel is too greedy by overselling your rooms. -newline- Jose Fuentes, the assistant Front Office Manager, was the one who helped to check in my relatives. Even though he said that he was sorry, you could tell from his facial expression that he did not mean it nor care a bit about the inconvenience brought to my relatives. I drove 3 hours to the airport , then the hotel and had not had dinner at 8pm. I could not believe such a "high class????" hotel would give such a first hand impression to visitors who are a good source of income to the US economy. Even though they did not charge for the night, but that was not what my relatives wanted. They wanted a room where they could check in right away and laid on the beds to relax. Since they prepaid the travel agency overseas, they had to go through the trouble to get a refund afterwards. So I was very upset and asked for some dinner vouchers to compensate for the additional inconvenience. Jose said hastily," You want dinner, let's go to the restaurant now!" He acted as if we were trying to take advantage of the hotel. Come on. Visitors who spent thousands of dollars really want to benefit a meal. -newline- I also cannot believe that the hotel does not have coffee pot in the room and the guest has to request it. We hated that we had to stay dressed up and wait for the delivery. For a lot of people like my husband and myself, the first thing we want when out of bed is to have a cup of coffee. This is especially important to travelers who have jet lag. -newline- Just want to advise other guests not to be fooled by this hotel by its star rating. It definitely does not deserve it. I give 2 stars for the location close to tourist attraction and the look of the lobby.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2012-04-09	5	Hotel has been totally renovated and rehabbed. The common areas both inside and outside, especially the pool area are a great plus adding a more resort-like feel to what is essentially a business/corporate hotel. -newline-  -newline- Room was spacious and well furnished--every room has a balcony. I could see the ocean--nice plus. Modern decor was very upscale, and an enjoyable environment. -newline-  -newline- Staff provided excellent service, when checking-in and out.

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2010-10-23	3	The hotel was considered a 5 star but did not have those accomodations.  Parking was extremely expensive and should have been disclosed; the marble on our floor in the elevator foyer was chipped very badly and could have caused a fall with heels on. There are no refrigerators or microwaves in the rooms.  The carpet on the terrace was badly burned with cigarette holes. The carpet had stains and the linens were soiled and cheap.  Pillows were stained.  I would definitely do an overhaul!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2010-07-18	4	The hotel was great.  Clean, nice sized rooms. Loved the balcony overlooking the pool area - every room has a balcony too.  The location was fabulous, about a mile walking distance to Beverly Hills shopping centers.  Great mall across the street with wonderful restaurants.  Staff was friendly and helpful, but service to the room was slow - it took over an hour for us to get a rollaway bed the first night.  (Due to a convention the hotel was hosting they were out of double beds and we got a king instead of our requested doubles.  We got our doubles the second night there).  If you want a coffeemaker in your room you have to ask for one, but it is free of charge.  Not the hotel's fault, but there were several guests having a party on their balcony at 3 am our first night there and they were extremely loud.  They were several floors above us, but we could still hear the noise quite clearly.  If you want to get your exercise without paying for the health club, there are a few walking routes that the hotel provided for me.  The weather was quite pleasant, and the routes were scenic, so a morning walk ended up being a very nice thing to do!  Pool service was great, and there were always nice lounge chairs and umbrellas available for us to use.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2010-07-09	4	The room rate from [...] was fare. But they get you on the back-end with food, parking/valet, mini-bar prices. This is a business property.

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2010-05-10	4	A family member (adult) was injured when the umbrella by the pool chairs blew over and onto her. Some umbrellsa had been closed, some had not been closed. The heavy metal center support rod hit her in the neck and shoulder fairly hard. That incident marred an otherwise enjoyable stay. -newline-  -newline- As for missing items: a coffee pot in the room would be a welcome addition. It is irritating to have to get dressed and go downstairs to Starbucks for a simple cup  of coffee. -newline-  -newline- The mini-bar "program" of "you touch it - you bought it" is irritating. Such an extreme measure is insulting to guests.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2010-04-03	4	The hotel was beautiful - I'm surprised [...] got it for me so cheap. My only surprise was that there is no parking for the hotel. I needed to valet my car with them - that costs $35/night. Perhaps this is in keeping with other area hotels - I am not sure. Hope it helps someone out to know up front.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2009-10-18	5	Great hotel stay.  From fast and efficient check-in through check-out, everything was tops.  The recommendations for dinner from the concierge were right on target.  Rooms were perfectly clean.  The food served for the business meeting I attended was excellent.  All opportunities for service were very personable and attentive.  Would have preferred that the Hyatt took the time to label the TV stations in the room TV (CBS, FOX, etc.).   As an out-of-towner, without the station labels pre-programmed, it was challenging to figure out the stations.  Not a big deal, but the only customer moment that this Hyatt missed.

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2009-08-23	4	We were in town for a wedding so we were not able to actually partake in too many of the hotels ammenities. However, the bar is very nice and the pool looked awesome.  Also, the hotel is right next to the Century City Plaza if you wanted to do some shopping or see a movie or grab some food.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2009-08-19	3	I found the hotel well decorated but a stark and cold ambiance - I would not stay there again - I think they are short of staff and seem not to take much inerest in their clientel.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2009-08-11	4	I took my 16 year old daughter and a friend of hers to Los Angeles for a shopping trip.  We chose Century City as we liked the shopping and location.  The hotel was across the street from the Westfield Mall, 5 minutes away from The Grove and 10 minutes away from the Santa Monica pier- GREAT LOCATION!! -newline- The staff was great, rooms were nice other than the flat sheet verses a fitted sheet on the matress which drove me crazy due to the wrinkles. -newline- All in all, we had a great stay even though there was construction Saturday morning at a hotel next to ours.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2009-07-31	4	The hotel is centrally located--makes driving to Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Venice, etc...very easy. -newline- Valet is convienent but pricey ($33/day).  The Valets are exceptional--friendly and reliable! the hotel lobby and outdoor grounds are spacious and lovely. The hotel has an incredible gym, but again there is a surcharge ($20/day)  Customer Service is lacking and inconsistant...Valet is exceptional but guest services needs improvement (conceirge could do better too.  Small talk is fine let's stay focused). -newline-  -newline- Example of customer service mishap: -newline- i heard a loud "drilling" sound coming from the room next door early one morning (6am) and called the front desk to inquire--is it the shower, pipes, etc?  There was no apology but lots of confusion. -newline- In the end, the noise went away 30 minutes later...did not hear back from the front desk?! -newline-  -newline- Overall--good hotel experience and very accessible for an L.A. vacation.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2009-07-30	3	The staff was fantastic. The rooms were nice but not that well equipped. There were 3 very small drawers under the TV and 3 even smaller drawers in a night stand. There was a large closet, but only 7 or 8 hangers.  We had to leave a lot of things in our suitcases. There isn't a coffee pot in the room, you have to pay for one.  Parking is expensive $33/day for valet, $25/day or more to self park.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2009-07-27	4	I thoroughly enjoyed my brief stay at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza.  I had business across the street at Creative Artists Agency, which made it extremely accomodating.  I particularly enjoyed dining al fresco @ the hotel restaurant Breeze's.  I will likely return on my next visit to LA.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2009-06-21	5	I attended a 2-day conference and my husband and 3-year old daughter came along to make it a family vacation.  Conference facility is excellent. Great attentive details were well put together at every aspects of this hotel.  There are 2 computer stations for guests to do their on-line check in and print their boarding passes across from the concierge desk.  Check-in staff was quick and professional when I ask to leave keys for my husband who will arrive later as I will be in the conference.  They are also very friendly in letting us have an 2-hour late check out since the conference ends at 2pm. -newline-  -newline- The most impressive service was the housekeeping staff.  We asked for a crib for my daughter.  They got us a brand new crib but neither one of the staff know for sure how to assemble it.  When my husband jumps in to help set it up (since we are parents with a 3-year old so we know the ins and outs of the 'safety' feature of these cribs), they gave us a coupon for free breakfast buffet at the hotel for the next morning.  It was a very nice gesture. -newline-  -newline- Breakfast buffet was very nice and staff went above and beyond to make my daughter happy with her breakfast choices.  Since the buffet has EVERYTHING but pancake, the waiter has the chef specially made pancake for my 3-year old when she said she would like that for breakfast.  He didn't even charge us for it!  This is service we expect from 4-star hotel, but still impressive when it is done in such a professional courteous way.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2009-05-31	4	The Hotel is in an excellent condition , the rooms are extraordinary , the bathrooms are well kept and have marmol counters, balconies are available in most rooms , the only problem is that the use of internet inside them is very expensive as well as the room service . The public areas are well designed , theres an array of restaurants , bars and exterior spaces to spend a good time. -newline-  -newline- The hotels staff is very kind and friendly . -newline-  -newline- The pool area is superb , it has a fairly large pool and a very relaxing hut tub. -newline-  -newline- A shopping mall is just a cross the street , beverly hills is 5 minutes away by taxi , sometimes the hop on hop off bus goes by the hotel . -newline-  -newline- Take a shared shuttle from tha airport , it will charge you 14 bucks instead of paying for a taxi that would cost you 60 dls.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2009-05-30	5	A great location for someone like me who had gone on business. The rooms are very quiet and very comfortable beds (a very important fact for me). The staff is very friendly. The Hotel has all the amenities one looks for.

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2008-12-29	5	This hotel was aoutstanding!  From the check-inn representative at the front desk to the valet parkers and the bellman, staff members went beyond the call to make our stay efficient and enjoyable.  The adjoining rooms for us and our children and grandchildren was a perfect set-up, with double doors opening on to a vestabule.  The kids could move easily between rooms without going out in the hall or disturbing other guests.  The hotel was spacious and felt like a 5 star accomodation - at a very good rate.  Valet parking at $33 per night was expensive.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2008-12-25	5	Our room was very comfortable, except the heat did not work during a very cod snap in December. The hotel offered to move us but we were really really happy with the incredible view off the City and Pacific Ocean from our balcony room on the Penthouse Level....so we just asked for more blankets. The parking is steep at $33. per day. Room amenities and service are top notch. There is a new movie theatre with 3D and IMAX right across the street. Excellent location. Everything is there except a coin laundry.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2008-12-04	4	Hyatt Regency Century Plaza hotel has a many good points for a view of Business.      Room was fairly enough big and clean and comfortable. Location is very quite and good for a business meeting and in and out to down town even easy excess to highway and all fashion districts like Rodeo,Hollywood etc.      Just leave it to Hyatt name and you wou't be dispointed.      Another point, Westfield Shopping mall is 5 minutes walking distance. You can see all brand name retailers and nice quality of merchaideses.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2008-11-02	5	I've stayed at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza hotel for work when I've had a press junket I was holding and had a fantastic stay during that time. The service was incredible for my accommodations as well as my event.      Then more recently, I stayed at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza Hotel for leisure (coming back to LA to visit friends) and it was just truly an excellent experience! The service was fantastic from the moment we checked in and it was just truly great the entire time. On Halloween night (our first night stay there), we came back to the hotel late and wanted a snack and although technically the kitchen was closed, they still made us the snack! Very nice treat for us that night!      I would absolutely recommend the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza hotel for those looking to stay in a classy, top-level hotel in the center of it all in Los Angeles.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2008-09-02	5	This hotel was a great hotel in every way.  Not only was it clean, had helpful staff, full of amenities, and good bang for the buck, but it was also perfectly located in the middle of all the bustle of Hollywood and the relaxation of the beaches.  If you're looking to go sightseeing all over LA, this is the location to be at.  This is where I will stay, next time in LA.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2008-08-25	5	The room was just fine with an open view,,,location worked well.      The food in the restaurant was fine but very expensive. Breakfast for two was over $50. The service there was great.      The concierge was not very good.  We asked for other restaurants in the neighborhood and his suggestion was Houstonsin the mall.  Houstons is a hamberger joint, crowded, noisy.  He did not mention the Asian restaurant across from Houstons that was sensational and not pricey.      We were there for a wedding so didn't explore.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2008-08-24	5	The Hyatt Century Hotel is about a 30 mins drive from LAX.  It is situated close to beverly hills and there is a mall/ theatre across the street.  Overall the neighborhood is well maintained and safe.  The hotel is well maintained as well and the staff are friendly, it is what you come to expect from Hyatt.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2008-07-08	5	The hotel and staff were great. My room was like a mini studio apt. The bathroom was made for royalty. It was huge, I could have fit another bed inside. However, the water pressure in our room could have been a little stronger. There was no fridge in the room but you could request one, as well as a microwave, from guest services. Be aware that you have to pay for the internet connection. The location was perfect for us. We were minutes away from the Santa Monica Poer, Venice Beach, Universal Studios, Beverly Hills, and much more.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2008-06-18	4	Beautiful, neat and comfortable place.      However, the failure of the Hotel to allow free mobile internet is a big minus. I called the Hotel before leaving NY to ask about wireless Internet access and they assured me they have. They did not say I would be charged for the access. I came with my laptop but it was an extra load because for the five nights I stayed at th Hyatt Regency, I never broused the Internet.       Not good for business!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2008-04-10	5	The Hyatt Regency Century Plaza was first class all the way!

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2007-11-29	4	We enjoyed the stay overall, but the breakfast restaurant was overcrowded and the staff could not keep up. Everybody was friendly and apologetic but it still took over 40 min to get our food.  The lobby bar staff was very friendly and efficient. The waitress in the night-bar was obnoxious and wouldn't leave us alone.   The room was very nice and comfortable. Door, Parking and Bell staff were great.   I would stay there again but eat and drink somewhere else.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2007-09-17	4	After receiving a warm reception, I anticipated great follow through.  The housekeeper refused to provide me with additional towels and made me call housekeeing.  Even they could not understand this.  The carpet between the beds was very stained.  The bell staff was fine and very helpful.  The daily parking rate was very high.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2007-08-06	4	The Hyatt was ok, the rooms were good size and the balcony was great.  No coffee maker in the room or bathrobes.  When I called to get them it took five hours for them to bring it, 11:00pm and we were already in bed.      Room service didn't get our order right on any occasion.      Bathroom light was inadequate.      Nightstand light was burned out.      Had to pay to much for internet.      No other coffee except for Starbucks and I don't like that brand.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2007-07-29	5	The Hyatt Regency hotel was beyond all expectations of accommodation for a last minute flight to LA.       After being greeted by the friendly staff at reception and throughout the hotel, I was even more impressed by the quality and cleanliness of the stylish and spacious room. The modern artwork, plasma TV and incredible bathroom was enough to excite me; not to mention the ample storage space, classy furniture, and beyond crisp white curtains, an outdoor sitting area that overlooked Ave of the Stars and it's wonderful water fountain.       Upon being ridiculously clueless in asking what i should see while in LA, the staff were more than willing to share ideas, recommendations and even went to the trouble of getting me safely in a taxi with a list of directions. The hotel is only an inexpensive taxi ride away from the beach, Hollywood Blvd and plenty of shopping opportunities, including a mall and movie theatre (which are in walking distance).       At night, the hotel comes alive with clubbers and party people..and when thats all over, retreating to your room and ordering a delicious room service meal totally tops off the Hyatt Regency experience.       Polite service, practical rooms and pleasant surprises are all found at the Hyatt Regency Century Plaza.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2007-07-17	5	The Hyatt lived up to it's quality. Although, I only stayed for one night the Hotel is beautiful and the staff was great. I have only one complaint. The price for one night was reidiculous. I realize I was paying for location and the price was comparable around town. Other than that, I would stay at the Hyatt again. The Hotel is right around the corner from Beverly Hills and not very far from Hollywood.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>
Hyatt Regency Century Plaza		2007-07-12	5	The Hyatt Regency Century Plaza has remained consistently good during my 25+ years of stays. The staff is courteous and efficient, the rooms are clean and constantly upgraded and the overall experience has always met or exceeded my expectations.           The location is also very convenient to everything.  The lobby is a great place to just relax -- morning and evening.  The addition of an actual Starbucks is also a great feature.           Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again when my travels call for an LA trip.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">2025 Ave of the Stars, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">LOS ANGELES</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90067</span>

Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles Pasadena--Old Town		2014-03-10	5	I rented a room for my mother to "get away" for a night for her birthday. She wanted to swim and sit in a jacuzzi. From the minute we entered the lobby, the hotel staff bent over backward to make her feel special. They gave her a coupon for a free breakfast the next morning, a "goody bag" with water and assorted snacks, and a small bottle of wine. They also let her check in early. It was first class service all the way, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone !	<span itemprop="streetAddress">180 North Fair Oaks Avenue, 180 North Fair Oaks Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91103</span>

Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles Pasadena--Old Town		2013-08-12	3	Staff was very personable and helpful. Great location in Old Town Pasadena. Close to lots of downtown restaurants and shops. Only two complaints about the room itself. The carpet was soaking wet! I understand carpet cleaning is necessary, but the carpet should be dry when you let allow a guest to stay there. I stood on a clean towel and noticed it was black the next day. I tried to turn on the heat to dry the carpet, but it immediately smelled like something was burning. I was only in my room for 5 hours so I wasn't too inconvenienced.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">180 North Fair Oaks Avenue, 180 North Fair Oaks Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91103</span>

Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles Pasadena--Old Town		2012-03-14	3	Close to rose bowl (that's what we wanted) - pool looked great, but we didn't use it. Lobby was beautiful (as were men working in lobby). Toilet seat was loose - asked for it to be tightened - was tightened and immediately got loose again. CHEAP - spend some of that money you spent on lobby on a good toilet seat please! 2nd bed had some internal spring damage - made noise whenever someone moved and was warped, so I felt like I was falling all night. People have previously complained about noise in reviews - but no noise from neighbors and slept with window open (facing freeway), but it didn't seem unnecessarily loud (but I'm from the city). We had wifi in room - worked great, as did internet access in lobby - 3 terminals. Appreciated having microwave and refrigerator in room. Finally, the self-park garage had multiple floors with parking on same level as room - so access was A+. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">180 North Fair Oaks Avenue, 180 North Fair Oaks Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91103</span>

Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles Pasadena--Old Town		2011-02-14	3	Upon arrival my first impression was delight at the modern and attractive public areas. The staff is friendly and helpful displaying positive attitudes. The new dining room is beautiful but the breakfast choices were limited so we left the hotel for another breakfast spot down the street. The room was small, generic, and dated. Could easily have been at a less expensive brand hotel. Linens and toiletries were equally generic. Marriott should spend some money improving the guest rooms now that they have completed the public areas. Also, haven't had a shower with so little spray power since I was last in a third world country.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">180 North Fair Oaks Avenue, 180 North Fair Oaks Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91103</span>

Courtyard by Marriott Los Angeles Pasadena--Old Town		2010-06-27	2	We selected this hotel because there are not many choices if one wants to be close to Old Town. [...] The tiny interior facing window looked out almost at eye level onto a roof strewn with cigarette butts and trash. On one side of our room was the vending machine room. Across the hall was the elevator. On the other side was an overlook to the main lobby. Needless to say it was loud. During the night we discovered the vending machine or ice machine was leaking and the carpet was soggy in one side of the bed. It must have leaked under the wall. We just got up and left as fast as possible the next morning. I didn't have the energy or the time to try to complain to the hotel. Even if all of the above hadn't happened, the hotel is just a bit shabby for the price.  I only didn't give this a single star because a Motel 6 type situation could be a bit worse.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">180 North Fair Oaks Avenue, 180 North Fair Oaks Ave., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91103</span>

My husband and I wanted to attend the Clippers and Pistons game and the front manager (Rich) went out of his way and ordered the tickets for us and had them delivered immediately at such short notice. Nichole, the font office manager was especially helpful during our 4 day stay as well. Every time you walk in an out of the hotel, valets and the doorman greet you . The hotel asks when you would like to schedule your room to be cleaned. It was a level of service not often seen and greatly appreciated. This is a great hotel in a wonderful location.

The Line		2014-03-21	4	It is a very cool hotel, right in Korea town and one block from my favorite restaurant ever, the Boiling Crab. We stayed in the Hollywood View rooms.... definitely pay the extra money for these rooms, well worth it and you will not regret it. Floor to ceiling windows were insane. Two down sides of this hotel: 1. They charge 35$ per night for parking, but do not tell you about it until you are checking out. A little advance warning would be nice. and 2. They automatically charge $150 as a "deposit" for anything you may use or wreck in the room. It is refunded to you in about a week. Kind of a weird thing.... you have my credit card info, if I broke anything you can charge it after, not before. But overall I would definitely stay here again.

I was surprised when I pulled into our accommodations that I was met with valet parking attendants who informed me that parking was $32/night. Not that that is not to be expected, but it would be good if that is included in hotel description. I would have appreciated knowing that. Because of a glitch in our wi-fi connection, without my suggesting it, a manager waived my parking fees. The room was different in its decor, but extremely comfortable.

The Line		2014-01-27	4	The hotel is beautifully renovated, but not always functional and staff needs to iron out the details: -newline- 1. A/C noisy (despite letting the front desk know they did not follow up, nor fixed the thermostat so the fan could be adjusted). Annoying! -newline- 2. Breakfast: great for people with sweet tooths, but croissants, pastries and cakes are not very healthy. All served in plastic cups and plates. Extremely snobbish or wannabe cool, but a new hotel ought to attempt to reduce emissions. Also nowhere to hang wet towels. No options to retain these and reuse. Not cool. -newline- 3. We ordered takeaway and when I went to the lobby to ask if I they could take care of the garbage the concierge explained there was a dumpster around the block I could go to. Nuff said. -newline- 4. When the glass lamp in the bathroom fell out of the socket and exploded the guys fixing it did a great job, but despite being glass everywhere the front desk did not offer any dcompensation. We travelled with an infant who was actually on her way crawling into the bathroom. No injuries, but scary. Again: too cool for skool. -newline-  -newline- Time to get sharpen up The Line!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">3515 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90010</span>

You cant do free parking. -newline- Im disappointed at site's explanation of this hotel.

The Line		2014-01-11	4	Excellent front desk staff including everyone we spoke with, however we were some of the first guests and there were a number of problems which were to be expected. Most problems were resolved within a reasonable time. One big problem was Housekeeping which should not be a problem even on start up. I have had better service at a $80/night motel.

Hilton Checkers Los Angeles		2011-05-23	5	I was looking for affordable hotels to stay in, downtown l.a., close to the action but not over, say, $150/night. I started out checking out the comfort inns, and other budget friendly types. however, i clicked on this hotel despite seeing the "Hilton" in front of the name and automatically knowing i wouldn't be able to afford it. Turns out, it was right around 150/a night, and fairly close to or just slightly more than the price of the budget friendly ones (i.e., comfort inn) PLUS on average, it was closer to all the action in downtown in l.a. the only negative i had, is that i called on the morning of my arrival, to confirm my check in and all that, and found out that they do a $100/night hold on a credit or debit card for incidentals. and while that wasn't a problem, it would have been nice to have been told that up front - say, on the confirmation email from [...], or something - maybe that is standard policy? but i didn't know, and would have preferred to have found out before me calling and asking about any and all possible other charges. However, they do return it within 2 - 4 days, pending there were no incidents. Other than that minor lack of communication though, i was pleasantly surprised about everything else. the hotel was classy, but intimate. Nice, upscale, but not over the top. the room was slightly smaller than i might have pictured, but it was comfortable and worked. if you want/need a refrigerator, its upon request - but no other extra charge. we even misplaced one of the  key cards, and i just knew it was about to be a crazy charge for that, but there wasn't. one of the bars/lounges we had planned to check out, The Standard, which I had been hearing about, was RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET. The Santee Alley was a close walking distance. There was a rite aid and walgreens right around the corner. it was a central to practically everything. the weekend we stayed, there even was a soapbox derby going on that we got front row seats to (via our view from our room) to! all in all, it was very pleasant. Oh and the front desk staff and bellmen were all EXTREMELY hospitable!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">535 South Grand Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>
Hilton Checkers Los Angeles		2011-04-03	5	I have been in Hilton hotels many times in different countries and always was fully satisfied. The location of Hilton checkers in LA is great - next corner to Millennium Biltmore Hotel, 2 blacks from Subway, 3 blacks from Music center and Civil center, few blocks from LA Convention Center. Front desk staff very friendly and helpful. Service was very good. The hotel areas were all very clean and smelling of flowers. My room next to elevator was nice and quiet. The spa and pool on top floor were great. The breakfast was not included but you can get it in the bet for $12 - European style and $19 - for American style. The dinner in Hotel Restaurant was good and not expensive. [...].

Hilton Checkers Los Angeles		2010-07-21	4	I went to LA to see my family on vacation. So we planned to stay at Hilton Checkers intially for four days. But after that we changed our plans because we didnt want to leave LA and we stayed at the same hotel for whole 15 days. This shows that the hotel was perfect. Amazing staff, amazing house keeping and wonderful location. The only problem is the parking that is like $40 a day which is outrageous. But you can park in Perish Square(A block away) for $15.95 a day which is not bad considering you are living in downtown LA. I would highly recommend this hotel to other people going to LA.

The room was great and the location was nice.  LA Live is walkable.  They had a flat screen TV in the room... though no HD channels which I thought was strange.  We usually travel with a DVD player but this time we decided not to.  I wish we had because unlike a lot of hotel rooms, this one actually had hookups for the DVD player to the TV.  The bathroom was lovely and a 2 headed shower was great!  The bed was comfortable and the linens and pillows were top notch.  Make sure you valet park because the lot next door will charge you over $50.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">535 South Grand Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

Hilton Checkers Los Angeles		2009-05-26	5	I used to live in LA but this time returned as a cultural tourist. As a New Yorker there for a long weekend I didn't want to be burdened with a car so I wanted a place within walking distance to Disney Hall and to the main subway hub. On top of that, the service staff was polite and deferential. The rooms minimalist/Zen decorated which was very relaxing. The bar served the restaurant food and it was delicious and quickly served. My first morning the hot water knob in the shower was broken. Within 10 minutes of calling Guest Services the engineer was in the room and had fixed the problem. Very clean room. Though I faced the street I heard no noise through the windows. The HVAC air system was super quiet; I could barely hear when it kicked in. I didn't hear guests surrounding my room or in the hallway.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">535 South Grand Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90071</span>

No, not ok. I left the hotel and they charged me for 1 nights stay. However I did not sleep there. Never again!

Even came to room while we were out to add ice to our champagne bucket so it would be chilled upon our return. Quiet rooms, comfy beds. One gripe, there was black mold under the clear calling in the shower. Easy I think to fix, not sure why it's not.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>

Sofitel Los Angeles		2012-08-31	5	I enjoyed the four days and nights I spent at the Sofitell Hotel very much. My accomodations were very satisfactory , commodious and comfortable. The staff were all friendly and ready to help with any problem. I appreciated their attention because I am old and disabled. Everyone I spoke to on the staff seemed to know who I was. The restaurant served tastefull, satisfying and nutritious food, well prepared and well served. As far as I am concerned, I looked forward with great anticipation to eating my breakfast there each day.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2012-08-14	4	The Sofitel in LA is by far one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in. It has a great location and the staff is very friendly. I would suggest this hotel to anyone looking to stay in LA.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2012-05-05	4	I had meetings I needed to go to down the street. I would suggest that this would be the best hotel to stay in the area. It's new and modern .   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2012-02-15	4	Love everything about the Sofitel except that the beds aren't the most comfortable I've ever slept in. Also, it'd be nice to have the option of snacks that aren't needing to be ordered via room service or taken from the very high-priced mini bar. Also, be prepared to bend down if you're taller than 5'6" for the low shower head. Other than that, a fabulous experience!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2011-10-29	5	We really enjoyed ourselves! The Sofitel hotel was absolutely wonderful, I would stay again.

Sofitel Los Angeles		2011-01-27	4	A pretty good quality hotel with a touch of class. The rooms are comfortable and the beds and bathrooms were both very nice. Only small gripes were with some of the service (especially from the concierge who seem to expect a tip everytime you ask them a quick question). It could also be considered pricey for some but I would probably stay here again as location is pretty much central in the Beverly Hills/West Hollywood area and enough places to eat and shop nearby.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-11-29	4	I stayed here during my LA visit to see family and friends over the Thanksgiving holiday. I chose the Sofitel after staying there a few years back when my company set me up there on a business trip. It was nice then, but it's even nicer now, after its renovation. Friendly staff, nice quiet rooms with updated everything. This is one of the few hotels I've stayed in recently that's had one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in! The lobby is ultra-slick with black and mirrors everywhere. My only gripes: no coffee maker in the room; no refrigerator other than the mini-bar; the bathroom sink in my room had slow drainage; at $29 per day for valet, I wish there was self-parking, at least at a lower rate - it's would also be nice to be able to retrieve last minute items out of your car without having to wait for the valet to retrieve them for you. Overall, though, very nice!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-10-12	5	The staff here were exceptional and very very polite.  They addressed any requests we had immediately.  The location of the hotel opposite the Beverly Centre was convenient for shopping.  We were in LA without a car but the bus stops/lines near the hotel were convenient to get around.  The concierge was helpful giving us clear instructions on how to travel around.  I would definitely recommend staying at the Sofitel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-10-03	5	Fantastic Hotel with excellent facilities.

Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-07-19	5	Great location. Very helpful staff. The free internet access was a bonus. Comfy beds and large bathroom. Would stay again.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-07-08	4	Front desk service was superb, with lovely upgrade, late checkout and lots of service and attention suitable for a woman traveling alone.  Bell staff also excellent.  The restaurant was also good, though not great mostly because of one slacking waiter.  Otherwise, the food was fine and other staff very good.  They were very accommodating at an off hour as well.  The hotel has been redesigned and is very contemporary and has and evening "scene".  This leads to rather noisy halls -newline- with people coming and going down to the bar but all settled down by 11p.m.  Also, do not get a room on the street as the traffic is noisy.  Overall a very good bet with great service.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-06-03	5	Great hotel and location.  Beds are superb.  The hotel itself is very beautifully decorated and right opposite the Beverly Centre for shopping.  Tour buses pick up at the hotel for LA tours. -newline- Would recommend.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-05-02	2	The hotel really isn't all that! The service was ok but when we arrived there was a mix up with our room so we were told that we were given an upgrade. After seeing the room my only thoughts were, "if this is an upgrade then what do the other rooms look like?" Also, our room window was right above a school and a day care and Monday morning we were awaken to the cheerful play of children. Couples, if you plan to choose this hotel upgrade to a suite or go somewhere else.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-04-28	3	This hotel was a great change! We usually stay at the Roosevelt, but haven't been happy there the past couple times we stayed. The Sofitel is clean, and cozy and in a great location, which is probably the best part about it. The only thing that wasn't too great was the room size, very tiny.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-03-15	5	Awesome place.  I would highly recommend it!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-02-11	4	We paid approx $360 per night for this hotel and definately got value based on the lovely room we were provided.  The Concierge left a lot to be desired, they basically were not overly enthusiastic with helping us get around.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-02-06	4	This is my second stay at the Sofitel.  As a former Beverly Hills and London Hotel lodger on a corporate budget, I was completely surprised to discover this little gem in the heart of LA.  Minutes from most of the "happening" destinations, the Sofitel provides superior service and amenities at a competitive price!!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-01-22	4	This was our first visit to LA.  We had decided to use it as a stopover.  We enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel, we found the staff very hospitable, the room very clean and comfortable. We had a late dinner delivered to our room, which was not up to standard, but breakfast downstairs the next morning made up for it.  We found the hotel was a little isolated for a days sightseeing, taxis were very expensive and not helpful, and public transport not easy to use.  We did very much appreciate the holding of our luggage after checkout. Yes, I probably would stay at the Sofitel again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-01-13	4	Great location, friendly staff, excellent room. Close to everything in Beverly Hills. And you can drive from the airport to the hotel without using the LA freeways! The hotel is a bit noisy, and the room service staff needs to be trained. Overall, we will return.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2010-01-09	5	We came to go to Rosebowl game.  Could not get in top hotels and one of the 4 season hotels recommended the Sofitel.  Great price and very nice service. They could not have been more helpful.  Even supplied a shuttle to the game.  Good room service also.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2009-12-27	4	Stayed here before and may again.  The rooms facing Beverly blvd are loud because the French doors do not seal and are not insulated glass.  Easy fix and they should do it.    Food is oustanding!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2009-11-16	5	This is a great hotel - the only thing it has wrong with it - is that there is no self parking - you are locked into using their valet service - not only is that service expensive - but also very slow.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2009-09-21	4	We stayed for 2 nights and enjoyed our stay very much. The location was great with much within walking distance. The hotel was very enjoyable although other than the internet service we didn't really use any other facility or amenity there. -newline- The only negative is that we were on our 1 year anniversary and I would have preferred a better view. We faced the Beverly Center Mall. The view of the hills would have been better.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>

Sofitel Los Angeles		2009-08-26	5	While probably a bit on the pricey side, the location is wonderful if you want to be in the area of the Beverly Centre, Robertson Ave, Melrose (short walk or small cab fare), Rodeo Drive (small cab fare), The Grove and Farmers Market (small cab fare).  The free internet access and bag storage on final day is also refreshing when compared to other hotels I stayed in during the trip.  This was the second time I have stayed at this hotel, and returned mainly due to the location more then anything else.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>

Sofitel Los Angeles		2009-07-13	4	Great location near many shopping options, including fantastic mall directly across the street.  Within walking distance of pretty, tree-lined  neighborhoods for safe walking excursions.  Excellent restaurants nearby, including locals' hangout, "Dominick's," for tasty Italian.  Will definately stay here again on my next trip to LA.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2009-06-20	5	I had a perfectly lovely stay at the Sofitel.  My room was spotless and comfortable, great bathroom, fantastic service, convenient location.  Wouldn't have changed a thing, except that the traffic outside was loud even though I was on the 9th floor.  Nothing the hotel could do about that, though.  I highly recommend the Sofitel LA.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2009-06-09	4	Great location, within walking distance to cafes and shops on Robertson, Melrose and 3rd St. Staff was very professional and helpful. Ask for rooms facing the "hill" not the street if you can.  They are very quiet, while the street facing Beverly Ctr is quite busy. If you're looking for a great pool, this is not it. Very small and not much space for lounge chairs, the hotel only has 10, which were typically taken. But everything else was great.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2009-05-16	4	You can't beat the location.  Easy access to Sunset, Hollywood and Santa Monica Blvd.  Also, a supermarket is a quick drive and a drug store is in walking distance not to mention the mall across the street.  Our first room was very small and not what we expected for $300 a night but the real problem was that the bathroom door didn't close all the way so you had little privacy.  Also, our view was the mall parking lot.  We complained a little and were able to get another room (many thanks to Elmer and the staff) the same day.  The next day, we were offered another room - bigger and with a view of the Hollywood Hills.  Since we were staying for 4 days that was really nice.  We still don't get why the bathroom doors (they are sliding doors) don't close tightly - maybe it's more for singles than families.  The rest of our stay was great.  The only other complaint would be that the only refrigerator is the stocked one so there is no room for anything else.  No coffee maker in the room but they do offer free coffee in the lobby.  If you rent a car which you almost have to in LA, and you go in and out a lot, you'll spend lots in tipping the valet guys and like most hotels now there is that annoying $29 per night parking charge. I suppose you could park somewhere on the streets behind the hotel but there are fences and other obstacles so I don't think it's worth it. Because of the close proximity to a major hospital, you will hear sirens periodically during the day and night but it really didn't bother us.  Room service is expensive - $30 for a personal size pizza and a bowl of soup which was not very good.  The lounge was lively and a celeb or two might have been seen but in LA you can't tell if it's really them or someone trying to look like one :-) -newline- Overall, I would definitely stay there again because of the location and the staff. If you have kids and don't plan on renting a car then this is not the place though.  But, if you want to jump in the car, head up to the Griddle Cafe on Sunset or head to Santa Monica, Hollywood or the Farmers Market than you are at the right place.  It's about 12 miles from LAX.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2009-04-28	5	Absolutely fantastic. The only draw back was the hotle room was a little on the small side. What the heck, i'm not in LA to stay in the room. I would definitely return. Thumbs Up. Loved the mall across the street.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>

Sofitel Los Angeles		2007-12-10	5	The hotel looks great and the staff were entusiastic and helpful. I am in LA every month and have stayed at another hotel that costs more and has a great reputation. For a fast 2-3 day trip I would and will(through you) now stay at the Sofital. The only thing that was lacking was a bathtub in the room.But the bathroom itself was designed very well.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2007-09-23	5	I went to the Sofitel with two girlfriends, for an all girls vacation.  From the minute, the staff was helpful, and really rolled out the red carpet for us.  They made reservations, called cars, and offered helpful advice on things to do in the area.  The locaiton was perfect, walking distance to shopping on Robertson and close to great restaurants and bars.  I would reccommend this hotel to anyone, particularly if you want to have the LA Glam experience.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>

Sofitel Los Angeles		2007-08-14	4	The room was small but very comfortable. The pool was a joke - too small. Overall, the hotel was very nice and comfortable. Our one complaint was the conceirge service. On two seperate occasions no one bothered to inform us that they were unable to secure our reservations for dinner.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2007-07-29	5	The Sofitel in Beverly Hills was wonderful. We had a late flight into LA and thought we were in trouble when we arrived...a guest decided to stay another night, so our room was not available. They paid for a cab and we were sent to another hotel for one night. When we checked in we were upgraded to a top floor suite overlooking the hills. WOW! The staff was very helpful and more than made up for the one night situation. The bed was so comfortable. Each room including the bathroom had a flat screen TV. The remote control shade in the bedroom was awesome. The bar area was incredible. I would recommend to anyone wanting to visit LA.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Sofitel Los Angeles		2007-05-28	5	Great location.  Walking distance of wonderful restaurants.  Shopping across the street at the mall is an experience.  The rooms were very contemporary and clean.

Would stay there again in a heartbeat.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">8555 Beverly Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2014-05-07	5	Me and my boyfriend stayed at the Lemontrose Suites hotel for four days, the hotel was great. Our room was clean and comfy, the staff was extremely nice and made sure we always had what we needed. Their service was always prompt. The neighborhood was quiet and was just a few blocks from Santa Monica blvd and Sunset bldv. The beaches are about 30 minutes away and got a little expensive using taxi's. Our overall experience was perfect, we couldn't have asked for more. Also the rooftop pool and jacuzzi was on the smaller side but the views were great.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2014-04-18	5	The staff was great they booked a car for us made all the arrangements the best is the location walking distance 15 mins to Rodeo drive 10 min walk to beverly hills.lots of great resturants in the area.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2014-04-17	4	It was a good experience. Unfortunately, the Le Montrose hotel was under a renovation, which I didn't know at the time that I made my reservation. It's a good hotel, if you want to be centrally located in West Hollywood, and you don't plan to spend much time at the property. The staff was very friendly, but the property lacks atmosphere and social environments. The wine list was poor for a hotel at this price point.l	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2014-04-14	5	The location is very accessible to everything and parking is not a problem (street and in & out valet). Staff is very gay-friendly, courteous and accommodating compare to other metro cities and hotels we have stayed. Very prompt on getting your car ready in 5 mins. Rooms are clean but during the stay they are changing carpet in the hallways, but didn't affect the rooms. I will definitely stay in this hotel again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2014-02-20	5	I needed a centrally located West Hollywood Hotel that was close to the action, but also quiet and suitable to take my daughter. This was a perfect choice. Phenomenally friendly staff, delicious breakfast menu, small gym and lovely rooftop pool. Also loved that I could open the windows in our room to get cool morning and evening air.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Rooftop pool is also small, but great view. Even better was the rooftop tennis court, got to play every morning (a nice workout). -newline-  -newline- Staff is very nice, and the valets work their a** off	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2014-01-06	4	In a great area tucked away in West Hollywood. Always a solid experience w them. Nothings gonna blow your hair back but you'll always have a good trip.

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2014-01-04	4	Le Montrose is a short, few block walk, to all of the great restaurants, shops and nightlife of West Hollywood. It's located just far away (3-4 blocks) in a residential neighborhood that it feels like an oasis away from the craziness. The front desk staff was super helpful and friendly with every interaction. The hotel itself is in very good shape, with newish soft goods and just a few slightly dated fixtures. Our only real complaint was that our sliding glass door was "permanently closed" which prevented fresh air from coming in the room. The AC worked very well, though, and at least some of the other rooms had serviceable sliding glass doors.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2013-12-10	4	The hotel was great just watch out for the parking charges and car rental. The charge me for the week instead of half a day. They need a new ball machine to play tennis with. The food was great but expensive. Your room was always kept clean. It was hard to store food in the fridge because they packed it up with tons of beverages you had to pay extra for if you drink or eat their snacks. Overall it was a great experience.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2013-10-07	4	My husband and I drove down from Big Bear for a night away from the kids. We picked this place because it was walking distance from the Sunset Strip. The staff was very helpful. The key entry to the floor with the guest rooms was very comforting security wise. The room was bi level, very clean and big with a fireplace and couch. The fashion was very 60's motif. The hallways were clean as well. They have a roof top bar and restaurant. They have free WiFi!!!!!! -newline- The cons; Parking is $38.00 self park or valet. The parking structure is very tight so if you have a big SUV like we did, it is kinda nerve wracking and tight. There is no ice machine, so you have to order it through room service with is $8.50 plus tip and it took 45 minutes to get to our room. I did write this down on the comments slip in our room and they gave us credit for the room service and parking. That was nice they cared. All in all I would recommend this place to anyone and would love to stay here again. -newline- P.S. Room would be suitable for our kids to come too. Couch makes into a bed!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2013-06-25	4	We has a good expirience at this hotel. The valet service is a plus since you always retourn tired from the day activities. -newline- If you can't afford a stay un one of the great resorts down un Santa M√≥nica with an ocean view, this is the best option to have a good location inside the city. -newline- You can walk to several coffees, restaurante and shopping. -newline- But for everything el de you'll need a car. -newline- The staff at the hotel is friendly and resourcefull.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2013-05-13	4	Just a few blocks of Santa Monica Blvd, in a quiet residential neighborhood, you'll feel secluded but still so close to the WeHo action that you can easily and safely walk the 2-3 blocks to some of the coolest clubs. The rooms are very comfortable and stylish, very comfortable beds. Skip the costly valet if you have small car but beware - the parking garage is cramped, oddly laid out and difficult to maneuver around especially if you have a big car.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2013-04-25	4	the hotel was very convenient to CBS TV City where we saw a production of DANCING WITH THE STARS. -newline-  -newline- We left a day early (stayed 3 out of four days) and were told to "take it up with the booking agent.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2013-03-29	5	The perfect quiet spot for my business trip. Highly recommended!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2012-11-12	1	Booked hotel through this site....got there and right away, felt like I was getting eye rolls because I only tipped the valet a couple bucks, OK, its a 4 star hotel, my bad, -newline- I came to the front desk and told them I had booked through O (this review site doesnt let u type in travel booking websites names)....they said okay, but looked confused...apparently there was a record that it was booked through O but no record that it was prepaid (ummm what? arent all O packages prepaid?) -newline- so they said ok, they needed a credit card for incidentals. -newline- Next day, their is a charge for almost $1300 , $400 more than even my stay , and i immediately freaked out and they said it was just an authorization. -newline- WRONG. When I was leaving, the front desk guy said "oh you need to pay for three out of the four nights" (my boyfriend had already paid one night plus all the ridiculous parking charges etc....and i said no, you guys already charged me an "authorization" and it was a prepaid trip through O,....confused face again, and he said "okay youre all set then!" .....we left, and to my surprise later, that authorization went through, along with several other random out of nowhere charges (we are starting to think they are for the room service we made sure to pay cash for) -newline- They are either really really confused, or just love over charging people and hoping they dont notice. -newline- Staff even tried to charge me to mail something out....not an issue, but at every other 4 star hotel i have been to, mailing a simple letter has been a complimentary service. -newline- This has been a nightmare...never got a call back or even an apology, just a bunch of annoyed front desk people when i called asking for my money back. -newline- Sorry, I dont just have thousands upon thousands of dollars for them to play with... -newline- I am still in the middle of the dispute process...needless to say, total nightmare. -newline- It was a decent hotel...liked room sizes and location was random but quiet....but i just stayed in a three star hotel where the quality was the same and the staff was more well trained and actually extended me discounts rather than triple charging my card. -newline- If you want a luxury hotel in Weho/beverly hills...stay at the Avalon....or the roosevelt....my two favorite hotels, and the residence inn hotels r nice for 3 star, free buffet breakfast and the rooms still have a luxury feel. Roosevelt is my fave but the rooms r kinda small....Avalon has awesome staff, is pricey but rooms r perfect. -newline- Never had an experience like this and even though the rooftop tennis is cool and their small pool is decent enough, I will never be back. they seem to think their hotel is worth triple charging customers and then not even apologizing or offering something to make me come back as a customer (i would never, they might charge my card 3k for incidentals) -newline-  -newline- le parc is way better too , but its their sister hotel so my guess is they still hire people that are undertrained and watching the clock til they can go audition and try to get out of their min wage hotel job.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2011-11-15	5	I have stayed at the Le Montrose suites hotel in West Hollywood on several occasions and I quite frankly will not stay anywhere else while in Los Angeles. The location is perfect and the rooms are spectacular. The rooftop pool and view are the best in West Hollywood.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2011-11-13	2	The rooms are very dated and is not what I expected from a 4 star hotel. The rooms were dusty and there was plastic wrap on all the glasses. The coffee maker was not useable:( Thank goodness my stay was short b/c I didnt feel comfortable here at all! The only great thing was the location of the hotel. It was close to the main strip.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2011-07-06	4	Spent a long weekend with the girls at Le Montrose and loved every minute of it. The staff was so friendly and accomodating, even to our daily calls for more coffee packets. There is so much to do in Hollywood, we needed all the caffeine we could get! The walking path they recommended was outstanding, and make sure to hike the hollywood hills in Griffith Park, what a view! I would definitely return	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2011-06-24	4	I stayed at this hotel during a recent girls weekend in Los Angeles.  The location was perfect for us...close to Beverly Hills shopping and the Sunset Strip.  The hotel sits in a lovely residential neighborhood between Santa Monica Blvd and Sunset Blvd.  It is nice and quiet and perfect for morning walks.  There is a neighborhood cafe that we walked to for morning coffee.The staff was extremely helpful with any request.  They even brought us cookies one day!  Four of us stayed in an executive suite and there was plenty of room.  There is a great dressing area where we could all get ready at the same time without tripping over each other.  My only complaint with the room is that it did not have central air conditioning. Only a wall unit which cooled the room fine it just didn't extend into the dressing area so it tended to get really hot with hair dryers, etc. Room has a small kitchen area with a coffee pot and coffee was replenished everyday.  If we ran out we called the front desk and more was supplied right away. -newline- I would definitely recommend this hotel!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2011-04-11	3	I was in LA on business and have stayed in this hotel in the past.  LOVE the location; LOVE the staff: LOVE the little restaurant AND excellent food. The roof deck is just great.  The hotel is also very clean.  The only downside is that the hotel is in need of a freshening up.  It is looking tired and worn. I would recommend the hotel as long as the person is accepting of worn around the edges.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2011-03-18	5	Outstanding location -- just minutes from Sunset Blvd., Beverly Hills, and other great venues -- all the while nestled in a quiet area surrounded by private residences and well-maintained condos and hotels. Staff was friendly and helpful. Terrific view from the rooftop pool. Gym is small and always available equipment. Will definitely return to Le Montrose.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2011-02-23	4	While there hiked canyon in hollywood hills, beautiful view, Cruised Sunset Blvd, Shopped Beverly Center. Location was not as close to downtown Hollywood/Sunset Blvd as I would've liked. Hotel very nicely maintained, plush atmosphere. Really disappointed that coffee was not available, not in room, not in lobby. Only through room service or mini restaurant. Early mornings in nice hotels require coffee. Pool on rooftop nicely maintained offered a beautiful view. Nothing within walking distance. Parking lot was tiny and pricey	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2011-01-09	5	Hotel was one street back off Sunset Blvd. Ideal area to walk in- amongst residences. Very helpful staff, nothing was a hassle. Big + was that we were able to wash and dry our clothes in the Laundry facility. Restaurants within walking distance- all types and close to famous hotels such as 'Whiskey a go go'. Short $10 taxi fares to The Beverly Hills Centre. $30 fare to Universal Studios. Thank you to the staff for making our last few days in the USA a trip to remember!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2010-12-11	4	Huge rooms with a lounge separated by a lower level as well as a walk in wardrobe. The restaurant on site looked old and tired so I did not try it. The roof top pool was nice during the day and at night with plenty of seats. Good location very close to Sunset Boulevard and a number of good restaurants that were recommended by the friendly staff.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2010-11-29	4	Great amenities.  Real comfortable boutique suite feel.  Executive suite came with fireplace that was gas powered and great. Bar and refridgerator items weren't at a gouged price.  Two flat screen tv's and a spacious dressing area were nice additions.  Good fitness center and rood pool and jacuzzi rocks. Xlent part of town within walking distance of a lot of good restaurants.  Center of west hollywood made MANY things convenient.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2010-10-05	4	There are several boutique hotels in West LA that are former apartment buildings.  As such, they tend to be all suite hotels, with generous living/dining space, private balconies and small kitchens.  This is a much better value than a larger resort hotel if you plan on spending any time relaxing in your room.  Be forwarned the kitchens don't come fully stocked, but the hotel will provide you with everything you need should you decide to do some of your own meal prep.  They converted the small fridge to a mini-bar so I had to move the beverages to make room for my wine and cheese, but it was not a big deal.  Beautiful roof top pool and hot tub with great views, and a roof top tennis court too.  You can't beat this place if you want to be walkable to the West Hollywood bars/clubs (very close to Abbey, etc).  Also very walkable up to all the cafes and retail shops as well as the live music clubs up on Sunset.  Parking is $30 a night, but that's West LA. Staff was friendly and attentive.  I would definitely stay here again, much nicer than the Ramada, not as large or trendy as the London.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2010-09-05	5	This hotel is great.  The hotel was very clean and quiet and the hotel staff were very friendly.  The hotel is in a great location within walking distance to Santa Monica Blvd and Sunset Blvd.  If your going on your own 80's hair band bar hopping tour this is the place to stay because you won't need a cab to get to and from the Whisky, Viper Room, Roxy or the Rainbow Bar and Grill on Sunset.  You can walk to them all in less than 5 minutes.  By the way, the scene at the Rainbow in the November Rain video was shot in booth 6 in the corner.  The walk from the hotel down to Santa Monica Blvd is a little farther than Sunset - maybe 10 minutes.  The view from the roof of the hotel is amazing!  I recommend the Star Line Tour that goes to the beaches, all over LA and movie star homes.  You basically get to see everything in one day and then can go back to a few things for a little longer like the walk of fame.  Actually, the star line office is behind the walk of fame and Chinese Theatre so if you arrive early for your tour, you could explore the walk of fame before the tour starts.  The tour drops you off on the side with the Chinese theatre so you may want to cruise the other side of the street first.  Enjoy Venice Beach.  You will find that it is not at all what they make it look like on TV!!  I don't want to ruin the surprise so you will have to see for yourselves.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2010-07-26	5	We stayed the Le Montrose hotel and we visitied the La Brea Tarpits and Universal Studios.  Each of those parks were within 5 miles of the hotel.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The pool was very nice and quiet and waas perfect for the hotel.  The 30 dollars a day for parking was a bit much, but there really is not much space to park anywhere else.  It was one of the best family trips we have ever taken and the hotel was a perfect place to be with the family.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2010-07-19	2	The location is not a very good area of town.  It is difficult, at best, to get to sightseeing opportunities.  Traffic, in and out, of the area is horrible.  No easy access to the freeways. -newline- They advertise, "full kitchens"...(What a joke!!!). -newline- Yes, they have full kitchens, but they are not furnished with dishes, cookware, utensils, etc.  You have to ask for everything to be brought to your room, as you think of what you need, which is very inconvenient. -newline- The room layouts on the internet are NOT what you get.  While the rooms are nice, it is not what you expect from the internet pics (floor plans). -newline- Valet service is great, but very expensive compared to any other locations we have stayed at. -newline- Staff was very friendly and helpful. -newline- We definitely would NOT return to this hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2010-07-19	4	Stayed here because of price & reviews.  Best price compared to surrounding 4 star hotels in west hollywood.  I had friends who stayed at The Andaz Hotel a mile away, and I think Le Montrose is better!  Although the pool is small, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful!  Loved the valet service, wish it was cheaper and not $30 a night.  You really don't have a choice, considering the hotel is surrounded by residences and there is no st parking unless you have a permit.  Fabulous hotel for a night on the town with friends!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2010-06-11	4	Overall the hotel was very nice, a little old but the people were nice which made up for it.  The room was spacious but the bathroom was super small, okay for one but no more than that, it would be hard for a couple to stay there.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2010-06-05	5	For an out of town visitor, the location can not be beat.Slightly hidden(meaning safety  and security), yet close to everything. I would call this a true hidden gem. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful. The rooftop pool, spa, and tennis court are great, too.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2010-04-15	4	The only thing impressive about this hotel is the size of the suites. The bathrooms were small, dark and in desperate need of a face lift! -newline- I got the impression that the sheets on our bed had not been changed when we checked in, but did not complain about it. -newline- The location is good (very close to Sunset blvd and Beverly Hills) -newline- The valet service is expensive (30$, but that's what you expect in L.A.) but the guys themselves were very helpful and accommodating.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-12-02	4	This is the third time we have stayed at Le Montrose. It is a great value for the money. The rooms are large, the bed is comfortable, there is a large screen TV on the wall in the bedroom area and another TV in the living area. Service is excellent. Employees are very friendly. We will definitely stay there again on our next visit to LA and our daughter and her family. The location is terrific, just down from Sunset Blvd and a couple of blocks from Santa Monica Blvd. Food at the hotel was good.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-11-09	3	The first surprise is the $28 dollar a night parking charge. That is almost $300 for the amount of nights we were staying there!  I was abit upset about that. My nephew came to visit for 2 hours and was towed outside the hotel.  To park at the hotel would have cost him $28.00.  No visitor parking for free -newline-  -newline- The first room was ok except when you attempted to pull the shower plunger to start the shower the whole unit came out of the wall! The floor in the bathroom looked dirty and the view was another building being costructed. -newline-  -newline- I complained to several staff members, then management and they had me pay about $200 for parking. They changed our room to a better suite that was nicer but the tub unit still came out of the wall some. (Not as bad as the first one though). -newline-  -newline- Had 2 large screen tv's with gameboy for my son.  Staff mostly was friendly.  Hotel is in a funky area of residential homes.  Is difficult to find at first. Had a cute little fire place.  Gave us a suite without any cooking utensils to use in the kitchen for the second room. -newline-  -newline- Over all it was an ok experience.  Not what I thought of for a 4 star hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-10-19	5	It truly was a pleasant surprise to discover and explore Le Montrose. The art nouveau decor was complimentary to the cozy and secluded feeling of the property.  The staff was invisible, yet accommodated my every request, and its laid back demeanor belied the fact that it was minutes away from LA's hottest destinations.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-08-23	5	The staff was great from the valet, to the front desk, to housekeeping.  The location is within walking distance of everywhere in WeHo you would want to be.

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-08-18	3	The hotel screwed up my reservation, then the front desk guy was rude when I tried to get it fixed. Orbitz did a GREAT job getting things in order. The hotel is in a very convenient location, but the 4 Star rating that was posted was definitely too high. The "multi-million dollar renovations" weren't enough and the $$$ was poorly spent. The carpet was unravelling. The bathroom counters and tile didn't match, cheap bath/showers, etc. All-in-all. . .3 stars and overpriced.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-08-03	5	I can't praise Le Montrose enough! -newline-  -newline- We were delighted with the location - less than five minutes from the heart of the Sunset Strip and walkable to much of West Hollywood, even as far as Robertson Boulevard and Melrose.  We did get a lot of attention because walking is just not done in LA but we found that we got to see the best of the area that way - cheaper and better than hiring a car to sit in crazy LA traffic.  The hotel reception will give you a map when you arrive and it is so useful! -newline-  -newline- The hotel itself is fantastic - the rooms well-appointed and spotless, courteous staff, great service (we used room service and the restaurant a lot) and a lovely pool area.  The pool is quite small but the rooftop location is beautiful and we never found it busy. -newline-  -newline- There is also a rooftop tennis court that we took full advantage of. -newline-  -newline- I would recommend this hotel for couples and friends rather than families perhaps, because of the quietly luxurious and quite formal ambience.  The hotel also attracts celebrities, as we found when we were there. -newline-  -newline- I wouldn't hesitate to return.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-08-03	4	I spent little time at the hotel, but was able to have a comfortable business meeting in the lounge.  Did not use the pool or fitness center.  Very enjoyable stay   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-07-09	3	The hotel was beautiful and centrally located to the attractions we were interested in. My reservation was made for 3 people to include a queen size bed and sleeper sofa. The reservation was also made for handicap accessible. Upon arrival, we discovered the room did not include a sleeper sofa and when asked about a rollaway, the manager was argumenative. The room all together was not handicap accessible, either was the pool. -newline-  -newline- We will not stay at this hotel again. We do not recommend this hotel for those requesting handicap access.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-07-06	4	The hotel is in a great location in LA, right in the middle of the action and yet is in a quiet street. The room was very large and comfortable, with all the amenities we needed. I would strongly recommend to a friend.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-05-28	3	The hotel rooms were beautiful.  However, the service is HORRIBLE!!!  I had to call the front desk and guest services 4 times just to get a cup of tea (it took over an hour).  The hotel itself is not as big as the website makes it out to be. Be aware of the $30 parking per night you have to pay, also, this does not guarantee a parking spot.  In addition a $300 hold on your card for any thing you may incur or break in the room is also required.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-05-15	5	We used this Hotel for the last night of our 10 day trip.  The hotel is just off the main strip so is nice and quite yet close to everything you want.  All the rooms are a very good size and well presented.  The small pool on the roof is the perfect place to relax with fantastic views across LA. -newline-  -newline- The exterior could do with a lick of paint but thats the only critism I can make. -newline-  -newline- The best way to sum it up is we wish we had stayed longer.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-05-03	5	The room and hotel had character.  I will definitely look to stay at Le Montrose on my next trip.  The only thing I would change would be the lighting in the room including the bathroom.  It was not makeup friendly!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2009-04-22	5	The hotel is situated on the edge of Beverly Hills.  There are a number of great restaurants within walking distance.  Rodeo drive is about a mile away, well within walking distance.  If you are a jogger, this is a great location with plenty of sidewalks and side streets.  I will definitely stay again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2008-06-19	5	I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights with my wife when we went to LA to visit my sister and friends.  The hotel is in a nice quiet neighborhood that's very close to shopping on Melrose and Robertson Blvd and the bars on Sunset.  We had a car which you need if you're in LA and it was very easy to get to everywhere we wanted to go.  The staff was nice and we loved the fireplace in the room.  I also liked the fact that the room had a sofa and armchair.  Our first day in we were exhausted from the airport and rental car agency and after we checked into the hotel we asked a porter if there were any good places to eat (my wife is vegetarian).  He suggested a place 2 blocks away and we had a wonderful meal.  It was a great way to start our time in LA.  We would definitely stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2008-04-20	2	Our first day, I was a little less satisfied with the demeanor of our check in staff.  I liked the layout, size and decor of the room, however, there was not enough ventilation in the bathroom/dressing area. Would have liked an in-room coffee pot (there was room on the counter in the kitchenette)and the parking fees were on the high side with no alternative street parkign.  Also, our room was above the entry door into the hotel and it was very noisy at night.  I had to put on the air conditioner to drown out the noise. Loved the cookies that were provided on our last night. I liked the larger than normal bathroom with a separate counter and mirror in the dressing area. Also, enjoyed the slippers that were provided along with the robe. Had to ask for a suitcase stand. This should be standard in the room. Loved the view from top of hotel of city and the pool and tennis courts atop the hotel. Liked the proximity to clubs, shops and restaurants from hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2008-03-15	5	The hotel was very comfortable, clean, cozy, and was in a great location.  Hotel staff was very accomodating.  The free internet service was temporarily down and they allowed their guests to use their computer.        The hotel is located in a residential areas right up the block from Sunset Blvd. that has many different bars, restaurants, and shopping. I was very impressed with the condition of the hotel and I would definately book another stay there.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2007-06-24	4	The A/C was off and it took hours to cool the room. I told them in the future to keep the A/C on the day of arrival. The hotel internally is chopped up looking and  the elevator not working on our last visit is still not working. The pool is great and the staff do everything they can to help. Location is convenient and the price is better than most area hotels.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>
Le Montrose Suite Hotel		2007-04-11	5	We enjoyed our week-long stay at The Montrose Suites Hotel in West Hollywood. The facilities are nicely decorated and perfectly maintained. Right from the beginning, the reception staff were very friendly and efficient. Although there was a misunderstanding with our reservation, as far as the lenghth of our stay, they solved the problem without even bothering us with questions or calls. The suites are tastefully appointed. The welcome-fruit basket and bottled-water are a nice detail. The mini-bar has much more to offer than your average mini-bar. Housekeeping was nothing less than perfect. The location, is perfect to visit and discover LA.    The only (minor) inconvenience was the tub/shower drain, which did not work properly. Other than that, this hotel and its staff was an overall great experience!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">900 Hammond St., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">West Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90069</span>

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2014-04-16	4	First note: Unless you want to valet (over $30 a day) street parking is right around the corner. -newline- Location - Perfect for us. Starbuck's, Bee Bee (breakfast) across the street, restaurants within walking distance (a few blocks), easy access to major roads. (We went to 6 Flags, Disneyland, Hollywood and Malibu) -newline- Room was clean, bed was so comfortable - we got a great nights sleep. (Stayed 4 nights) -newline- Staff - Limited interaction with staff but always pleasant. -newline- Amenities - Good and sometimes odd - They use shampoo and soap dispensers which are better and reduces waste but it reminded me of gyms that do it and well that is not good, shower was good not great, glasses are open and not covered or sealed - this freaks me out as I never know if they really are clean, the same goes for the coffee, mugs and spoon area - the spoons were just out on a paper towel. Sorry it looked cheap and I wouldn't use that spoon ever - sorry lack of trust here to - I would expected wrapped silverware like a restaurant - just kept thinking how many people touch this and never use it. -newline- Pool is small but nice and there is a hot tub. -newline- Value - Thought is was an excellent value	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2014-03-19	4	This hotel has the friendliest staff. They are very accommodating and courteous. Every time you pass an employee they will great you and let you pass. As far as other services, room service is quick, but pricey, but that was expected (i.e $19 for an omlette). Location is great, its close to LA and not more than a 30min drive to the beach. The only downside is that there wasn't any parking garage, you had to park on the side and back streets in a residential area.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2013-12-27	5	The Amarano Hotel is flawless. It was the perfect choice for celebrating Christmas with family. Closeby to relatives in The Hollywood Hills, we also enjoyed easy driving experiences to Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks and The Americana Mall in Glendale (great shopping!). The lobby is beautiful, festive yet serene with a burning fireplace and a relaxing library sitting area. The staff is very welcoming and attentive and the rooms are immaculate. We like the free WiFi and big screen T.V. (frige is fully stocked) and the plush robes. The hotel's lobby bar is an amazing setting for a night cap before retiring to The Amarano's luxurious accommodations.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2013-09-05	4	I couldn't have spent my 4 days of work in a better place for the money. The rooms were clean and modern, the front desk staff was helpful, everything worked properly in my room, and the internet was free. Right across the street from the hotel. was a strip mall that included a Strabucks, a place to send packages, a drug store, a grocery store (where you could also get a Starbucks), a great breakfast place, a sushi place, a place to get your nails done, and a pet store. The downside, the rooms have less than average views, and only the pool view rooms have balconies were you can sit outside (more expensive) and the hotel parking is $32 at this publishing. You can park on the street around the hotel for free if you can find a spot. The neighborhood is reasonably safe. It is mostly rental apartments that seem to be kept up well.

The staff were cordial, friendly, and helpful. However, I thought it was strange that patrons have to pay extra to use the cabana in the pool area when everything at poolside should be for the use of the patrons at no extra cost. I think management needs to rethink their policy. My husband and I didn't want to swim but during the evening or early morning thought it would be nice to sit out by the pool under the cabana and write, since we are authors, and maybe read, but we weren't about to pay extra for the privilege that should have already be included to the guests. -newline- A bit pricey for what you get.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2013-03-31	5	The Amarano Hotel was comfortable and staff friendly and helpful. Our room was spacious, bed luxuriously comfortable. We loved the pool area, private and not too crowded. -newline- We were able to walk to local restaurants. Wanted to get to Bob's Big Boy Car Hop type restaurant for the Friday night car show, to which we could have walked-ran out of time. -newline- The hotel staff was willing to drive us anywhere locally, and did so a few times. Universal Studios was nearby-generally found Amarano to be centrally located.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2013-01-27	3	We were originally placed in an upgraded room but it was directly above the exercise room. We were rudely awakened twice at 6 AM to the thump-thump-thump of runners on treadmills. Don't stay in room 241!!! -newline-  -newline- On the third day, the staff moved us after we complained, to a suite on the other side of the hotel. It was nice enough, but I noted that a small tissue scrap on the floor in the corner of the bathroom stayed put for three days, which led me to wonder about the overall cleanliness of the hotel. -newline-  -newline- The hotel looks great and the rooms are spacious, but the overall experience was just average.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2012-10-24	4	The bed was super comfy, the bathrooms were all tile with granite counters, shower had a built in tile bench seat with 2 shower heads! The room smelt like new carpet that's how clean it was. There was a little dust here and there but nothing to really be upset about. The staff was very professional, inviting, and polite. Parking is a bit expensive but there are free parking areas close by. It's near the freeway but quiet, very close to a supermarket, Starbucks, awesome breakfast joint called Bea bea's and a cheap smoke shop. A little spendy but ultimately worth it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2012-09-26	5	We stayed at this hotel on a trip to Universal Studios. It was in a PERFECT location. Very quick drive to the park (about 5 mins). And away from the busy touristy crowds. Stores, Starbucks and food places right across the street, and some more a couple blocks away. quiet location. Super comfortable room. The room and bathroom were clean, except a little soap on the shower walls. Thats my ONLY complaint but everything else was so perfect it did not ruin the stay. Friendly staff! I would definately stay here again and again!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2012-09-09	4	Great place to stay after outings to crowded tourist/hot spot areas in Los Angeles. Gym, sauna, spa, pool all clean even though are small. Private luxury boutique to stay in. High priced valet can be avoided by parking on the street. Location is close to many major freeways, Portos bakery, and WB studios. 2nd room switched in was much more quieter and less noisy from neighbors, who were cooking next door, smelling through the double joining room we had. Staff was accommodating and nice. Grocery store, open late is across the street.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2012-07-24	4	The location was perfect for everywhere we needed to be. It was a welcome respite from the mid-day heat and offered a very comfortable, restful bed. The kitchenette was just what we needed and all the extras were perfect. The hotel bar closed a little too early for our schedules, but the bartenders still sold us beers to take back to the room. A pleasant surprise overall and much better than expected. Will definitely come and stay again - and recommend!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2012-07-18	5	The moment you walk in, the hotel is beautifully decorated and the staff is extremely friendly. Our room was beautiful and was so very comfortable. The location was great for Burbank. It's next to the 134 Freeway and right across the street from a Vons for anything you may have forgotten. There's no doubt the next time I need to stay anywhere near the valley, I'll definitely be staying at Hotel Amarano	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2012-07-16	4	The only parking was valet. This was an additional 35 dollars a day. I thought this was an excessive amount since we were hotel guest. I was traveling with a disabled person and could not park, on the street a block away.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2012-06-18	4	First I have got to say is if you are reading this then you are at least remotely interested... Do it. It's worth it. My boyfriend and I needed a place to stay out in valley area after having a concert and club night we both knew we didn't want to drive up to Ventura County at 3am. -newline-  -newline- All pictures shown on web are accurate. Beautiful room with a very comfy bed. The modern look gave me a relaxing feel with a mixture of texture walls and soft linens. Our room had a beautiful belcony that had a pool side view. -newline-  -newline- I had two things I saw as negative but not deal breakers... 1). Valet parking that costs $30 bucks for overnight guest... Way over priced, since we are Southern Cali residents we travel light so parking the car on the street one block was not an issue, 2). There is no view from any room. That being said since the inside is so comfy, hopefully you won't want to look out. :)	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2012-06-18	4	I was looking for a last-minute hotel for an overnight visit to the L.A. area (I live in OC). Stumbled upon Amarano at a great discounted rate just a few hours before my intended check-in. The hotel was fantastic for the price I paid ($139 for a standard King). Fully-stocked kitchenette, great flat screen TV, cozy bed. The only downside was that it got really crowded at around 7 pm. Their small valet area simply could not accommodate the rush of cars coming into the hotel. It took us 20 minutes to get our car, with quite a bit of chaos as the 2 lone valets struggled to move cars to give us room to exit. Other than that, though, it was a great visit.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2012-05-28	4	The staff was very friendly and helpful. The room and the hotel were clean and very nice. There were some areas that needed attention. One of the lamps in our room was seriously broken, and the blankets were old and thin and scratchy and stained. The bathroom door didn't lock. But I think they are in the middle of a big remodel most everything was new and nice. The pool was very nice, and they had a very nice fitness room. The staff was great.The location and neighbor hood were great. All in all, it wasn't perfect but it was nice and we had a pleasant stay. I would stay there again. I can't wait to see it when it's finished.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2012-01-05	3	Despite internal rivalry over the Rose Bowl game, we all enjoyed a few days at this Burbank Hotel.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2011-10-24	5	I came to Burbank to go to Unversal Studios for the Halloween horror night. I didn't think I would get a great deal for booking this hotel last minute. the hotel shuttle picked us up from the airport. I expected it to be a shuttle bus, but it turned out to be a limo-like sedan. this hotel is small, but cozy and I like it better than a big hotel. it was very luxurious. workers were very friendly and I would love to stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2011-06-07	4	The hotel seems a bit understated from the front but when you walk in it excudes luxury. Our room was very spacious with a very comfortable king size bed. The eye pleasing colors in the room were very relaxing. The room was very quiet and the drapes kept the room dark for sleeping. The large flat screen TV made it very enjoyable to watch. It was nice that the hotel had a towncar to pick us up at the airport and drive us anywhere within a 3 mile radius. The bar had a beautiful fireplace and plenty of places to sit as a couple or as a group. We would definitely stay there again!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2011-03-01	4	Nice little hotel with clean large rooms.

The location is not bad- you are close to Hollywood, and not far from downtown.  Bea bea's for breakfast seems to be a huge draw- it is right across the street, along with a cute Grocery store- you have a kitchenette in the room- so take advantage of that!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2010-08-30	5	The hotel was awesome..  I stayed here with my son, as we were heading to Universal Studios.Got it for a 30% discounted rate, however, the regular price of $159 a night would have been just fine under normal circumstances.  The pillows were way better than anything I've ever slept on and the sheets were soft as well. The bed was comfortable and the room was tip top. The "shuttle service" was actually a Lincoln Towncar, and shuttled us to and from the park. I would stay here again, and will.  Definitely recommend this hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2010-08-22	4	Our stay at the hotel started out rough when they didn't pick us up at 10:00 at the airport because they said that they shut the shuttle down at !0:00 but after that the hotel was a 5 star experience with a grocery store across the street and being right in the middle of all the excitement around Hollywood while being in a very safe neighborhood with easy access to the LA metro system which took us everywhere we wanted to go. But what we enjoyed about the hotel the most is how nice the employees were. The employees helped us with great suggestions and advice of great things to do and great restaurants to visit. Also they were very interested in how our trip was going. It is a wonderful hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2010-06-12	4	This hotel is in a convenient location in relation to Universal Studios (about a 10 minute drive), and you don't have the typical traffic associated with being near a main attraction.  The rooms were clean and comfortable, and staff members were friendly and helpful.  In addition the overnight valet parking fee ($28) is relatively cheap in comarison to other major metropolitan areas (i.e. San Francisco).  Lastly, the restaurant across the street (Bea Bea's) has the best breakfast this side of the Mississippi!!!  I'm not trying to take business away from the hotel's restaurant, but visitor's have to try Bea Bea's. We will definitely stay at the Hotal Amarano during our next visit to the Burbank/Hollywood area.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2010-04-22	5	Great hotel. Staff was very helpful. Jacuzzi and sun deck on the 4th floor were very nice. Our room, 218, was directly over the lounge terrace--unfortunately we had to call down twice to ask people to stop smoking (posted signs state no smkg). Request a room that is not directly over the lounge. Room was clean, beautifully decorated and very comfortable bed. Ice bucket was dirty. Made good use of kitchenette fully stocked with dishes for two. Valet parking is $28/day. We parked around the corner on the street. Residential area and we felt very safe parking our car among other condo/apt owners. Side entrance to the hotel made this very convenient. Dining prices at the hotel were $$$$ so we chose to eat across the street at several places. Recommend the pumpkin pancakes at BeaBea's, pricey for breakfast but great food and friendly staff.  Also ToGo sandwiches, take-out Japanese rest/sushi, Italian place.  Von's groc convenient also. Great place/location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

The staff was pleasant and accomodating. I was in Burbank to visit my family but I require privacy so the Amarano became my home away from home. -newline-  -newline- The only comment is that no one answers the phone when you call room service after 11:00 and there is a limited 24 hour menu.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2010-02-06	3	The hotel had a great location.  It was very close to WB Studios in Burbank and the Burbank airport. The hotel claims to have a car that will bring you where you want to go, however it is first come first serve and the car does not operate until about 6:30 or 7 am so if you have an early flight plan on paying for a taxi (about $20 to the Burbank airport). [...]We ended up getting a two double bed deluxe room (smaller) when we paid for a superior room (larger). There is a drug store and grocery store across from the hotel which is a nice bonus in case of midnight munchies or lost baggage. Friendly staff. Beautiful lobby. Room had a couple issues...broken toilet seat, lamps by bed did not work, heat never kicked in. Otherwise quiet and comfortable.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2009-10-05	4	The hotel had a great location in burbank; albeit it was a little difficult to find because it blended in with the surrounding houses and condos.  It was really close to everything i wanted to do and see, and was right next to the WB studios.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2009-07-07	4	Small, interesting hotel. Tasteful, well appointed room (Deluxe) with kitchenette (refrigerator, sink, coffee machine, microwave.) Staff was quite helpful with all requests. Intimate pool and jacuzzi on the roof. HDTV, clock radio (docked w/iPod). Walk to restaurants. Bank, grocery and drug store across the street. Near Warner Bros and Disney/ABC. Fairly late check out (12:00P). Only drawback, no self parking unless on street, leaving pricey valet as only option on hotel grounds.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2009-06-01	5	We had a great time staying at the Hotel Amarano.  It was in a great location, not far from Warner Brothers studios.  The rooms were very nice and luxurious. There is valet parking for $28 a day, but  we parked on the street and it was just fine.  The only problem we encountered was the hot tub had cooled down as the area closes at 10pm.(A little too early, I think) -newline- Highly recommend the Amarano.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2009-05-26	4	It was our 1st year anniversary!  To celebrate our weekend, we drove straight to Universal Studios and had a whole day of fun, fun, fun!  Then at dinner time, we headed for our hotel stay.  I'll have to say we were quite nervous about our hotel stay because we had had so many recent hotel stays that were just unpleasant and even raunchy!  I guess you get what you pay for!  You see, we don't get the privilege to stay at luxury hotels because it's always about the money.  However, this time for the first time, we were determined to stay somewhere nice for once, so we saved our money for one nice hotel stay.  We work too darn hard in this world to stay in a raunchy hotel again!  We would have to agree that our stay was the best we have ever stayed in our adult lives if you could believe.  And we are 34!  It was better than the Tropicana in Las Vegas that my fiance's employer paid for and better than the grand hotel my employer had us stay in San Diego: both of which we did not have to pay for!  My favorite part of Hotel Amarano Burbank were the minty colors of choice.  It gave the room a new vigor and cleanliness that I really hold of high importance.  Everything was spotless.  I especially loved the shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, and lotion, magnified mirror and 7ft to 8ft by 4 ft mirror for a woman's grooming convenience!  It was the first time I did not use my own, since I am extremely picky with this kind of thing.  My fiance's favorite item in the hotel was the 46 inch flat screen LG TV with a Panasonic DVD (electronic details complimentary to my fiance).  This deluxe hotel with a King is perfect for the couple in love!  The mini kitchen made it very nice for me to make my hunny breakfast in the morning, since we had brought so much food for the trip.  I'm glad we did.  Continental breakfast just doesn't do the job for us.  We had a very romantic and tasty dinner at Smokehouse just down the street and had left over steak and boiled eggs as well as freshly cut veggies and fruit, blueberry muffins, and freshly brewed coffee.  The freshly brewed coffee was provided by the hotel.  If you really have some cash to spend, there was basically a fridge full of a variety of liquor for the alcohol drinker as well as some assorted candies, but we didn't get any of that.  But what a convenience!  The bed was extremely comfortable.  I really enjoyed the two sliding doors I could open in the morning or late at night to allow some fresh air in the room.  I found it nice to be able to sit at the desk to plan out our day in downtown LA and Venice Beach.  I especially love the check out time of NOON!  I'm so used to 11:00am and rushing to get out.  The only thing that caught me by surprise was the parking.  I had no idea that I wasn't going to be able to park my own car.  It is all Valet parking.  I kept thinking, "Oh gosh, another expense that I did not expect!"  Sure enough, a little over $31 a day for Valet parking!  I really wish this would change!  Customers should really be able to have other parking options.  And the Valet men stand there for a tip: sad thing is, I don't carry cash, so I hope they didn't think I was rude when I didn't tip.  Although I loved this hotel stay and I would stay here again, I do plan on checking other hotels and their accommodations as far as parking and their pricing before I book or just save extra money to accommodate this parking cost.  Despite the parking expense, we really enjoyed our stay and wished we could have stayed at least one more day, since we didn't even get the chance to enjoy the spa!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2009-05-25	1	This hotel cannot be compared with Best Western/Marriot Courtyard but yes may be Travelodge or Comfort Inn. With 2 kids we were not provided with 2 Queen size beds and had to be content with a King Size bed. Not sure what the Hotel staff was doing while checking us in.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2008-03-01	5	The Hotel Amarano Burbank is a lovely hotel.  The rooms are nice and the beds are especially comfy.  There was a flat screen TV in our room.  There was a small shopping center across the road from the hotel. My only problem was transportation options.  Since my friend and I did not rent a car, we had expected to use the shuttle at least a few times.  You should know that there is a 3 mile radius for the shuttle service.  That does not get you far in L.A. On the day we checked out the hotel was changing shuttle providers and was not able to offer us a ride to the airport.  That was especially upsetting since we had stayed there for three nights.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Hotel Amarano Burbank (Formerly known as The Graciela Burbank)		2007-08-07	5	The Graciela Burbank, BURBANK, CA, is an outstanding hotel, great rooms, perfect location.  The only complaint it there is no sign on the street to show its location.  I drove back and forth a few times before I found it in the dark.  It is close to WB studios, Disney Studios and Universal.  Only valet parking, which can be a bit cumbersome.  But the staff and location make up for it.      I would recommend this to anyone that is not on a tight budget and would enjoy more upscale accomidations.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">322 N.

Leider musste ich Spuren vom Vorg√§nger in der Dusche sowie auf dem Kopfkissen feststellen, was ich dann auch an der Reception meldete. Die Unanehmlichkeiten wurden in der Folge nur teilweise behoben, was auf mich nicht ganz den Eindruck eines vornehmlichen Hotels macht. Ich werde dieses Hotel sicherlich nicht mehr buchen, da ich mir von den USA besseres gewohnt bin. Das Personal war jedoch sehr freundlich.

Hilton Los Angeles North--Glendale & Executive Meeting Ctr		2013-05-20	3	Ordinarily, I would give this hotel perfect ratings. I have stayed here many times while visiting Glendale. It has always been my hotel of choice there. -newline- This stay, when I reported that my coffee maker would not function, the staff immediately set a replacement in the works so that I would have it the next morning. However, they did not offer me complimentary coffee in the hotel restaurant. -newline- I was also quite inconvenienced by the self parking situation. Each time I attempted to enter the parking structure, my ticket would not work, necessitating my contact with the front desk. Frankly, I got tired of waiting in line there so many times to validate my parking. I was not offered any complimentary parking for the inconvenience, until I asked for it. Then I was credited with one day's parking. -newline- Other than those two minor problems, I am satisfied with my hotel stay in Glendale.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">100 West Glenoaks Blvd, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Glendale</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91202</span>
Hilton Los Angeles North--Glendale & Executive Meeting Ctr		2013-04-08	2	The room was tiny and the layout uncomfortable. The only chair in the room was 2' from the TV (and no other space to move it to) so it wasn't usable for sitting watching TV. The bed also did not face the TV. After a long day/evening out it was tough to come back and relax. It did have a nice window seat but the desk was placed in front of it. The bathroom did not have a magnified mirror - something that is standard at other hotels. Location has road noise even in the upper floors. There is a $19/night parking fee.The good news - it was clean and has a nice public space (although busy with events).	<span itemprop="streetAddress">100 West Glenoaks Blvd, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Glendale</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91202</span>

The town of Glendale is 1 mile away and the Americana Mall area was beautiful. My major complaint is paying $18 a day to self-park.

Disappointed that WiFi was not included. If McDonalds can offer free WiFi so can the Hilton. I refuse to pay an extra $12.95/day. There are a lot of nice shops and restaurants nearby (on Brand St.).

Hilton Los Angeles North--Glendale & Executive Meeting Ctr		2011-09-06	3	First of all, this is a good hotel. Very comfortable, clean and the people there are very nice. There are two things I do not like -newline-  -newline- (1) Location, the location is not very good. I have to drive additional 15 mins to everywhere, including San Diego and Disneyland. It is close to Universal Studio, but still takes 15-20 mins to arrive there -newline-  -newline- (2) Parking. Parking costs me 18$ a night. There parking fee calculation system is terrible. When you arrive, they give you a piece of paper and ask you to show it whenever you arrived or left. However, due to some technical problems, they gave me a new piece of paper every time I arrived, which is very annoying. Also, they assume you park every night if you arrived with a car. I happend to park elsewhere for one day, but they still charge 18$ until I pointed out. In sum, parking system sucks.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">100 West Glenoaks Blvd, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Glendale</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91202</span>

I was glad to see that there were no additional fees when I got there. A lot of times the hotels charge daily fees and things that are not included in your package when you initially book. I would probably go back if I was in the Burbank area again.

She was rude and abrupt and did not make me feel welcome at all. All the other staff were very helpful and friendly. The pool was fabulous and they have a great gym.

We've stayed at several downtown LA hotels in the past and enjoyed them very much.  But we think we'll return to Glendale to explore the surrounding communities in the future.

The room was nice, but there were no instructions regarding using the "snacks" refrigerator.  The water pressure in the shower was low, so the shower was not what I expected it to be.  The health club had the best equipment and hours of operation, 24/7,I have ever seen in a hotel -- fantastic!  The room service was fast and great.

Hilton Los Angeles North--Glendale & Executive Meeting Ctr		2011-02-23	4	It's a nice, clean hotel. The location is very confortable, across the street you have the Conrads restaurant with great service 24 hs, with half a price of the hotel restaurant. Parking is extra 18 dollars a day and you have no other option near. You have only free wifi at the lobby and at the rooms is very expensive. The neiborhood is very quiet and safe, banks and offices only, you have some Sturbucks, gas stations and a lot of nice restaurants a few blocks from there. You also have Glendale Galeria at 10 blocks that is a huge mall, with target, Macy's and watever you may need to buy.I recommend getting a car because you've got 15 to 20 minutes to anywhere. The hotel is quite old but you have lcd in the room, good matress, pillows and bathing stuff, great view from our room we can see the sun rise over the hills and the snow mountains in the back.

Hilton Los Angeles North--Glendale & Executive Meeting Ctr		2009-11-09	3	My girlfriend and I took a celebratory trip to the LA area for the weekend.  The hotel building itself and the individual room were nice; the bathroom was especially spacious compared to most hotels which was appreciated.  We asked for one thing while staying there and the service was poor.  We wanted 2 wine glasses and a corkscrew since we brought some of our own wine on the trip; they charged us for the glasses!  This is the 1st I've ever heard of such a thing.  The $1.50/glass wound up being over $7 after the delivery charge, service charge, and tax; and all that occurred after the front desk woman said she'd have it sent up, which she never did so we eventually noticed nothing was coming up.  After calling down, it still took them 20 minutes to bring up what we asked for.  That definitely put a damper on the hotel experience, as did the parking garage being poorly run as well.  Overall, the physical building was nice, but don't expect good service and if you do ask for something, be prepared to pay for it in time, money, or both.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">100 West Glenoaks Blvd, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Glendale</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91202</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2014-02-16	5	Picked this hotel because we were attending the LA Artwalk. The location was perfect due the close proximity to the galleries. Maybe a 6-7 block walk. The hotel staff was amazing-very friendly and truly made us feel welcome. The breakfast buffet was delicious and the staff even remembered that I liked cheese on my scrambled eggs every morning! I would highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay here again in the future.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2013-05-14	4	My son and I were in LA to attend the Pac 12 track and field championships at USC. We enjoyed the hotel and particularly appreciated its location in the civic center area. Right across the street from the beautiful art deco LA city hall and down the street from the LA Times building, another notable deco building. Also very close to the Metro Red/Purple rail line Civic Center station.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2012-06-01	4	I've stayed at this hotel twice and since it's been remodeled its still great and comfortable! The staff is always helpful, easy check-in and out, a taxi is usually waiting outside or the front desk will call one for you! The rooms are comfortable, clean and modern with a view of downtown. It's near Little Tokyo and not too far from the airport. I was very pleased with my visit.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-12-27	3	Disappointed for the price we had to pay. Someone had removed the refrigeration we had expected to be there.

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-11-04	4	Great location for my business trip. The hotel was amazing, especially the outside garden experience. The room was exceptional, and had all amenities one could need. Only issue was that the room I was given already had someone in it when I almost walked in on them. Good that the TV was blaring and stopped me. The front desk graciously gave me another room on a higher floor with a better view.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-10-12	3	Not a bad location for downtown LA. Near Phillipes for the best beef dips in history. Walking distance to a fun bar, The Edison. Some construction outside and parking a pain in the underground, especially on Sunday with Church services in the hotel. Basically, it worked. Would stay there again if I needed to be in downtown LA.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-09-30	3	This hotel was conveniently located near the fashion district. They also have a complimentary van that takes you within 3 miles of their hotel and the drivers were very nice. The hotel itself was nice and clean. The workers at the front desk were nice and helpful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-09-12	3	The front desk staff had to do a lot of work to overcome certain deficiences. No hot water, a REALLY noisy AC system, and a business center that struggled with basic business shipping was annoying. Still the staff was helpful and friendly and I hope those things will be fixed. Still, I won't be staying there anytime soon.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-08-17	5	I really enjoyed my experience here. Especially notable was the staff - starting from the parking area to the front desk staff and others. Rooms are a little small, but clean and everything was in working order. For the value in an area so close to everything in downtown, it can't be beat.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-08-01	4	We stayed here to attend a concert at the coliseum. Since many places were booked for the show and the xgames, this one was reasonable and close enough. The taxi ride cost almost $30, but we were able to take the bus home which worked out nicely. The hotel was just fine for the price. Rooms were clean and comfortable. My sister mentioned being able to hear the guys next door late at night but I slept -newline- Through it. Thankfully. Staff was friendly. The garden was nice.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-06-08	4	I found that the staff was unfriendly. Because we did not book the room directly with the hotel, they were not accommodating to my request. When I originally booked the room through Hotel Club, I specifically requested for a king bed, however when i arrived at the hotel, they gave me a room with two double beds. when I spoke with the hotel in regards to this, they specified that because we used a third party vendor, we get what is available at the hotel. If that is the case, then why do did the website make you choose the room type? All in all, I pleaded with the front desk person who finally switched our room. It was just a headache trying to check in.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-05-14	3	I enjoy this hotel and love being in Japan Town. The only draw back is Valet Parking, it takes forever, they need another person on week-ends. But the location for me is very rewarding for my business. I can meet my guest and they enjoy the gardens and even a Starbucks on the property!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-05-09	3	Hotel shuttle service for 3 mile radius was convenient. The hotels lobby was beautiful. The only problem was the room didn't look like their website, and there was no pool. I was looking forward to eating at ALL of the restaurants in the hotel, but only the same two were open the entire time we were there. The customer service was great.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-05-02	4	Kyoto Grand is located on 1st Street and LA Avenue downtown.  It's 5 blocks from the Disney Music Hall (amazing!) and the Music Center where the LA Opera performs, as well as several theatre companies.  Many art galleries are near-by as well. -newline-  -newline- The hotel was clean, well-kept and the parking valets quick and friendly.  Room was nice, with a large, comfortable bed. -newline-  -newline- Downtown itself can be quiet at night, but LA Live is five minutes away.  We liked that downtown was a little quieter.  We could head out to Hollywood to party and have a good time and then come back to downtown and relax in a more low-key environment. -newline-  -newline- LA has many, many places to party if that's what you're looking for.  It also has plenty of out of the way spots for "adults" to have an evening of causual elegance. -newline-  -newline- We enjoyed our stay in LA and would stay at the Kyoto Grand again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-04-18	4	The Kyoto Grand Hotel was beautiful. I had a very nice room. I wish I had a nice view though. Like one that is facing Japanese plaza. I loved the bed. It was very comfy. The garden was so pretty too. This hotel have pretty much everything.. as in a car rental service, resturants, bar, fitness room, salon, and etc. The only problem I had was the fridge did not work and the sink in the bathroom did not drain well at all. But then it didn't bother me much.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

I had a corner room with a queen bed, couch, mini fridge, safe and walk in closet. It also had an amazing downtown skyline view. staff was amazing, room service was quick and the food was good. doormen were perfect in opening doors and getting cabs for me. Definitely will stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-02-26	2	They need to inform us that they charge internet per item per day before we book the hotel. -newline- If we add the expense on internet and parking it is not cheap to book that hotel online at all......   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-01-09	2	Average. -newline- Good points : -newline- - The hotel is big -newline- - Rooms are clean and nice -newline- - Big TV -newline-  -newline- Bad Points : -newline- 1. Cleaning lady came 8am n the morning and asked us if we had checked out?? Hello...!! And she came back 3 times until we finally checked out! -newline-  -newline- 2. Rude staff -newline- 3. Worst hotel lobby in the world. So old n tacky..eww! -newline- 4. Horrible fitness room..machines were just OH-so-old! -newline- 5.

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-01-04	4	Very nice hotel lobby and semi-updated rooms.  Clean and comfortable.

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2011-01-03	3	Hotel met basic needs, was in town for the Rose Bowl and within easy walking distance to the train to Pasadena.  I heard some of the hotel is remodeled, but our room certainly wasn't, while it appeared there was new carpeting, nothing (including the TV) had been updated since about 1989.  I would only book here again if it was significantly cheaper than the Westin, Hilton, etc...	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2010-11-15	4	The reception staff was wonderful. They were very nice and willing to help. I talked to them for a few minutes about why I was here - I had an interview in the morning and an overnight flight afterwards. He let me have a late check-out at 3 pm, even though the check-out is at noon. That helped me out a lot. -newline-  -newline- The room itself was neat, but not very new. The room sheets looked a little dingy, and the carpet was worn. However, it sufficed. The bathroom was very clean and big. Try to get a double queen or a king-sized bed, the room will end up bigger that way. -newline-  -newline- The hotel has a shuttle that will drive you to anywhere you want within a 3 mile radius, it does go to the USC Health Science Campus. It is very convenient, especially when taxi prices are ridiculous. However, they only have 1 car for the entire hotel, so you will have to wait for service. I, personally, did not wait long - I only had to wait 15 minutes for the pick-up and the return trip. -newline-  -newline- Overall, a very nice hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2010-09-29	5	Rooms are nice and clean, beds are super comfortable.

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2010-08-26	3	The hotel lobby is beautiful so when I arrived my first impression was very positive.  Although this hotel must have been glamorous long time ago, it is not the case today.  The rooms are large enough and clean, but dated.  Bathrooms are very small. Two restaurants and a bar near the garden (nice, but small) are closed down. I felt the hotel was somewhat abandoned. Quiet, but not in an enjoyable way. Good price for the location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2010-08-18	4	The hotel was nice looking and it was the perfect location for checking out Little Tokyo, Chinatown, the beach, and etc. I like the oriental design of the lobby. As for the guest rooms, the negative thing is the bed was made with no fitted sheet. They just put another topped sheet on top and tucked it in. And the bathroom floor was dirty. I really like that we are right in Little Tokyo because we spent most of our time walking around Little Tokyo, checking out the shops, the restaurants, and the Nisei Festival. Everything is within walking distance and also they have a grocery store near too. It would be great if there was a microwave in the hotel so I can reheat food that I've bought and couldn't finish. We also checked out Chinatown (which is like 5 to 10 minutes driving distance) and the beach!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2010-06-02	2	Long wait lines at the front desk. Find out at the time of check-in that parking is $24/night for self park or $30/night for valet. Across the street is a self-park lot for 7 a night, so definitely go for that and save you a TON of money, along with possibly seeing your car from your room like we did. Make sure you check your invoice... because they'll charge you for parking, even if you didn't use it. Had to speak with the woman at the front desk to get the charges removed. -newline-  -newline- Bathrooms were sub-par. Wallpaper was peeling off the walls, no ventilation fan for humidity of shower, light switch on the OUTSIDE (which was odd), dusty and mildew tiles in the bathroom as well. -newline-  -newline- Also, 9.95 a night for internet? I've been to MANY hotels... and I did not expect to have to pay for internet at a hotel which tries to have a "luxury" ambiance, but finds ways to gouge you in any way they can. -newline-  -newline- If you're a smoker, you have to smoke outside the front lobby or in the garden... but there are no butt cans or ash trays available on the garden level, just FYI. -newline-  -newline- All in all, it wasn't a HORRIBLE experience... just a lot of oversight on details that you'd expect to be standard in a room for the price you're paying. 2*/5*	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2010-05-16	4	My wife and I went to the hotel after our wedding night.  Like most newlyweds, we were looking for peace and quiet after the whirlwind of the wedding and reception.  There was a major party going on in one of the ballrooms, but our room on the 5th floor was spotless, elegant, and comfortable.  No problems with party-goers roaming the halls, and a view of the rooftop garden greeted us the next morning with serenity.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2010-03-12	5	The hotel was beautiful. I loved the Japanese decor and found the hotel to be very spacious. It was useful having the shop within the hotel and hotel parking. I also loved the gardens (although I was expecting a roof garden). I used the gym facilities which were fine and found the bedroom very comfortable. -newline- The negatives are its location. Although this is within downtown LA, it was far from the main tourist areas. However, if people don't mind using public transport, the train station is about 10 minute walk. The hotel was also expensive for dining in and there are not many places nearby that we found.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2010-01-24	5	My sister and daughter both brought cars to the hotel and the Manager gave me a deal for the parking, which would of cost quite a bit.  We were really happy w/this and the location around the Civic Center, Little Tokyo, and Olveria Street, and Union Station were all centralized for convenience.  I was sorry not to have more time at the Kyoto to enjoy the gym and lounge area.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2009-12-10	2	We were deceived by the photo slides of the Hotel Room. Thinking that we will be staying in a more stylish room, we went ahead to booked this hotel. However, when we got into the hotel room, we realised that its not what we see from this site. We managed to ask the hotel front desk, they mentioned that that room is an executive room. It was no where mentioned in the site. Tried calling the manager a couple of times. But not replies from him. What kind of customer service is that?	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2009-12-07	3	Adequate is how I would describe this hotel.  It is very close to the federal buildings if you need to be in that area.  However, the rooms are dated, they definately need some attention, the bathroom was uncomfortable in its layout.  The lobby was very nice and the Japanese rooftop garden is a plus if you're traveling with a group.  There is a parking lot directly accross the street if you need to save a few bucks on parking. The room rate was good compared to other hotels in the vicinity so if you need a fair rate it should work for you.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2009-10-20	2	The room was clean and nice, but I had to wait 15 minutes to check in (with no one in front of me) while the one woman at the desk answered the phone. I had a meeting with a make-up artist with bags in my room, and it took 30 minutes for a bell captain to arrive. When I was heading out to my event one night, I went down to the self-serve parking only to find that the valets had parked about 5 cars in front of mine.

If you don't like jazz, too bad because you can hear what's going on from every room.

Charges $30 per night for valet where there is only 1 employee, and it takes about an hour and a half to have your car brought up.

Overall, for the price requested, I think Kyoto Grand was a perfect deal. -newline-  -newline- The flaw this year was Internet Connection: I brought with me 9 collegues in a business trip and working from the rooms was simply impossible. And this for 10 $ a day per computer (for 10 people for 8 days it's a lot of money, wasted because of the poor wireless connection). -newline-  -newline- Kyoto Grand should really address this issue, because even if I really like the hotel, its restaurants and its position in L.A., next year I'm going to move to another accomodation because of the poor bandwith experienced last week.

There is an outdoor lot across the street for $10 over night, but there is no security, so park at your own risk. Clean hotel, but kinda pricey. One annoying though was the japanese drums that i heard in the morning around 10-11 AM. I was still sleeping and I could hear it from my room, so it was sorta annoying.

The home has pretty much every thing that is needed. Want to use the Internet for a short time, you may want to use the computer in the business center, which is free for 5 minutes usage. It is good if you just want to do a simple google map.  The breakfast in the restaurant is quite expensive. A cup of tea would cause more than 3 dollars. Other than that, the hotel is quite nice and comfortable.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

The location was accessible to the DASH or the bus line, taxi's were available.  My suggestion: bring some oatmeal to make in your room using the coffee pot for hot water and bring some fresh fruit and yogurt for the mini fridge.  The music that was played in the lobby was obnoxious...remember I was in the lobby for sometime before I got my room key.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2008-09-14	4	The hotel employees were very nice and friendly.  The room service for the breakfast was bit expensive, for typical breakfast.       We had a smoker's room.  Whem opened the window, but found there was no screen to protect bugs from coming into the room.  I got bitten and had to close the window. But when windows were closed, ventilation was so poor I asked my husband to smoke in the bathroom.  I think it could impove it's ventilation.  But overall we had a pleasant time at the hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2008-08-31	5	Finding a decent hotel at a reasonable price in a major city is always a challenge. Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens is good value for money. Our room was sparkling clean, spacious, and nicely decorated. We were especially taken with the Japanese Garden and the first-rate fitness center. I would have been nice to have free Interent. Overall though, it was so pleasant, we look forward to staying here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2008-08-10	5	We had a 16' truck with equipment that we had no place to park.  The surrounding lots would not accomodate us overnight.  The manager was very helpful in solving the problem.  My only complaints would be that the bed wasn't very comfortable and we couldn't find a late night snack when we returned to the hotel.  No pool but the jazz in the beer garden was great!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2008-07-12	5	I was here distinctly to attend an art opening at the nearby Japanese-American National Museum. I don't have a car and here in LA I didn't want to be taking the train home late at night. After checking-in I spent a relaxing afternoon/evening in the gardens and enjoyed drinks and a small meal. Great selection of drinks and food and they had 'happy hour' pricing.  The room ws all I needed, a basic room with CATV, king bed, and the bathroom gad all the basic amenities you would need. The best feature of the room were windows that would partially open for fresh air, as opposed to the adjustable AC and they also has a series of sliding panels wich would allow sunlight through but obscure the view. You could slide them around to whatever degree of closure/openness desired. After I returned back that night I capped off the night at their Genji Bar, open till 1am. I liked the hotel and area a lot.The nezt day I had the American style breakfast at their Garden Grill. I explored the surrounding area on foot and had lunch at a nearby Japanese eatery. Back at the hotel I went back to the outdoor garden for a drink or two, they had a wedding that night so the gardens were basically closed to other guests. I hung out at their Rendezvous Bar (Lobby Bar) and met a bunch of other guests and about five of us had quite a long time together, including the weekend bartender, I think his name is Roberto and he makes the best Mojito you will ever have. I got some good suggestions for dinner and they proved to be good. The hotel has a few other nice looking restaurants with nice views but they are  bit pricey. While the hotel does not have a pool/hot tub, they do have an on-site spa whose prices weren't bad at all; various types of massage and sauna services. Overall a great experience close to all the downtown/little Tokyo area has to offer. CLose to the Metro station and free parking for those driving.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2008-06-08	5	Kyoto Grand Hotel and Gardens is a comfortable, and clean choice.  The surrounding area, Little Tokyo, is safe and quiet.  The check in was hassle free.  The room was decent size, comfortable, and clean.  Clean towels, soap, shampoo, and conditioner were restocked everyday.  The wireless internet has a surcharge, so I just went to the Starbuck's up the street, and used their's.  The hotel also has a Starbuck's in the lobby, its a smaller, but suffice.  This hotel has a great centralized location for L.A., but you probably still need a car though.  If you're driving, you can pack your car in the lot across the street for $8 per 24 hours.  Personally, I parked at a meter, along the side of the hotel. I was out of the space before 8 every morning, so I didn't have to pay the meter.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to a friend.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2008-05-25	4	Kyoto Grand Hotel was very clean,had a great bar, and plenty of restaurants, but I would recommend it for a business trip or a quick stay.

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2008-05-11	5	My husband and I stayed here overnight to go to a Dodgers game. The hotel was close to the stadium and very comfortable. The room design was unique and I loved the angles of the room--very different from your typical square box. From what I could see, the bar was nice and there was a cute little art gallery as well. It was definitely not a luxury resort, but it was nice, clean, cute and had everything we needed. Also, our room overlooked a rooftop garden owned by the hotel that had walking paths and fountains. A wedding was taking place there so it was fun to watch.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">120 South Los Angeles Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90012</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Los Angeles Downtown		2008-01-08	4	I thought it was a value for its price and I liked how close it was to everything in Little Tokyo. I didn't think it was maintained that well.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2013-05-30	2	My fianc√© and I arrived on Tuesday around 2pm and were met by valet. We unloaded our luggage which included one suitcase and 2 paper grocery bags that included some snack items, 2 odawalla juices and 4 bottles of beer. Per the valet we were not to worry about our luggage that once we get checked in our luggage will be delivered to us in our room. After checking in we went to room 835 and found a very lumpy bed and smaller then what we expected room. We went back to the front desk and asked if there was a different room that we could have for the night stating that we'd pay the additional $50. After waiting in the front for roughly 20 minutes we were taken to a cabana room to take a look at it. We decided to pay the extra money and took room 118. We asked that the front desk make sure that the valet knew that we had been moved to a different room. We waited over an hour and still had not received our luggage. I called down to the front desk and was advised that our luggage would be delivered shortly. We then received a call from the front desk as they could not locate our luggage. I advised that we had originally been in room 835 but moved. He stated he'd find our belongings and get it to us quickly. After receiving our belongings we unloaded the grocery bags to find that our beer and juices were missing. I went down to the front desk and double checked the car to ensure that the valet hadn't put the beers in the car and they were not there. They compensated us with a few drink vouchers and corona's. The rest of the evening was filled with the people upstairs dropping things on the ground around midnight. Wednesday morning the cleaning crew was making a ton of noise right outside of our door. After checking out we stood in front waiting for the valet to bring us our car for more then 20 minutes. The car was just a few feet from us so we just asked for our keys and walked to the car. The overall stay was disappointing due our items being stolen in the beginning. This caused an uneasy feeling the entire stay that a staff member could come into our room and take any of our belongings. Although the staff compensated the stolen items we really feel that there should have been better compensation due to the invading of our privacy.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2012-10-18	3	I stayed at this hotel on a business trip. I would not recommend it for business travel because it was very loud at night with receptions and events being hosted there. However, it would be a fun hotel to stay at for vacation. They have outdoor movie night at the pool and the bar by the pool seems to turn things into a night club atmosphere during the warm "summer" nights. -newline-  -newline- Also, the air conditioner was so loud that I had to turn it off at night to be able to sleep - and I'm the type of person that can sleep through just about anything. -newline-  -newline- Bottom line: If you're going to Hollywood for fun and don't plan to sleep much anyways, this hotel is perfect for you. If you're traveling for business or with kids, stay away!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Many of the other hotels in this neighborhood looked run down or unsafe. -newline- I was upgraded when I arrive from a cabana garden view to a cabana balcony view. There is something going on at the pool every night. It can be a bit loud, but I enjoyed listening to watching all of the fun from my room. The music seems to just stop at 1:30 at last call and then it's silent. If you are in LA for business, a cabana pool room is not recommended. -newline- I would stay here again in a heartbeat!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

The Hollywood Walk of Fame is of course right under your feet. Best staff I've ever encountered. The place is clean, high class and beautiful. Usually when you go to the pool in a resort, you see a bunch of people who shouldn't be in bathing suits, but not here. I thought I was at The Playboy Mansion!. The pool is a party scene on the weekends as the have DJ until 2am. There are also cubs and dining in the building.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2011-09-06	5	I loved everything about the hotel. It is great for young people. The clubs in the hotel are amazing, the pool is great and the location is to die for.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2011-08-15	4	The Roosvelt Hotel has an excellent location, however is not the best hotel to bring your children. If you are a couple or with a group of friends this is the perfect hotel for you. The Tropicana Bar in the pool area has great drinks and the enviroment day and night is awesome. I will definitely go back to this Hotel next time I visit L.A.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2011-07-27	4	I checked into the Studio King (approx 500 sq feet) on a Saturday around 3pm with ease.  The 10th floor (12 Total) room was clean and surprisingly well appointed logistically for only 500 sq ft.  There are 2 bathrooms (one with shower/tub and the other with shower only).  It was on the end of a hallway/corner and had a good view of the Tropicana Bar/pool.  The service was good but it felt forced and not done with too many smiles.  The lobby definitely makes you feel the Hollywood vibe around midnight to 1am.  We had a great time at the difficult to get into Teddy's and stumbled back to the room for an after party as did many others in our hallway but the noise is kept out once you are in the room.  My tip:  Walk across the street to Petes Coffee to grab a refreshing coffee drink before checking out, you will need it as you wait for valet which takes awhile.  I experienced some of the best service while at valet.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2011-07-22	5	Outstanding location, beautiful common areas in the hotel. We booked a two double bed room and it was very snug.  Decor was very simplistic and not what we expected for the price we had paid.  But I guess we paid for being on Hollywood Boulevard and having the walk of fame outside our door.  That was awesome.  Would definitely stay there again because of location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2011-05-01	3	This hotel is probably in the best location as far as being very close to everything and is a short walk nearly everywhere. Better be 40 years or younger as there is plenty of young people that dance and sing in the hallways until 4 AM every night! Great eye candy around the pool during the day for either sex, but better have a fat wallet to pay the bill for beverages and food. Staff was awesome, and we traded our room without to much fuss. Nice upgrades to building but definitely no more than 3 stars	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2011-04-18	3	We got to the hotel around 6pm on a Saturday and after checking in, we were looking for a place to eat. The concierge recommended a seafood place and since we hadn't been to L.A. in over 10 years, we went for it. While the food was very good, it was overpriced and not the environment we had told her we wanted (fun, lively, etc. This restaurant was much more dull). -newline-  -newline- On the morning we checked out, I called ahead so the car would be ready. Unfortunately, I had to ask three separate people to get our car, which finally pulled up after close to 45 minutes after my original call. -newline-  -newline- Aside from those two issues, the hotel is in a great spot for site seeing and the lobby/bar was wonderful.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2011-04-16	3	Beautiful hotel with great dining options. Rooms a decent size - only disappointing part of the visit was my first room was obviously close to the club as from 11 pm I could here music thumping; changing rooms took over an hour (which seemed like forever as I was very tired) and the next room they gave me stank of smoke so I had to move again (hence the 3 stars rather than 4). No business center.

The Garden/Pool rooms are under renovation and the job they are doing is top class.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2011-03-25	4	Overall, the experience was pretty good. We stayed for 3 nites. Great location right across the street from the Kodak Theatre, Wax Museum, Chinese Theatre - that's the plus. Older, classic hotel - dark accents, style.  Hotel is a bit "stuffy" - real Hollywood, LA-ish. When we inquired about nightclubs in the area, we were told by the Concierge that "well, we have one of the best in our hotel, but I don't think you guys can get it!"	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

A CVS to Louie Vuitton. The Roosevelt is hard to beat when wanting to stay in a high end convenient space in Hollywood. -newline-  -newline- Usually we stay at the Renaissance, which is very nice.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2011-01-27	4	Stayed for three days over a weekend.  Excellent location near the Kodak theater and the Hollywood & Highland metro.  I rode the train to downtown and North Hollywood with ease.  The Hotel was sleek and the room nicely remodeled, but a not quite worth the cost.  Great atmosphere and really busy at night; not for those seeking peace and quiet!  The pool bar and restaurant are hangouts for Hollywood locals (and supposedly celebrities, I only saw one) so be prepared to mingle if you head down.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2011-01-10	3	We went for a party and hotel had an excellent location.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-10-03	1	Very poor overall experience with the Hotel Staff to provide room that was contracted. No attempt was made to tell us of their inability to provide the contracted room, as if they were trying to do a bait and switch. Room was not the pool view as specified in the reservation and it was also next door to the restaurant. The room air conditioner was broken and the room was over 80 degrees at the time of our late check in. The night manager took no responsibility and we left without a word of regret from the staff.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-08-25	4	This is a refurbished hotel in the middle of Hollywood Blvd.  As a New Yorker, it was a good stay in a warehouse, loftlike designed hotel.  The poolside was noisy at night and the 20somethings were all excited, tipsy & happy, however I was pleased that the front desk put us on the side of the hotel where we didn't hear the noise.  The suites were well appointed and roomy.  Great for a small party with our frineds.  Food expensive.  Staff was wonderfully pleasant and helpful.  We were there for a weekend wedding and fullyu enjoyed ourselves.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-08-21	1	This was the second time I stayed at the Hollywood Roosevelt.  The first time was over a year ago and I had a lovely time (girly weekend, birthday party pool-side).  This time at the Roosevelt, it was the worst hotel experience of my life.  And I have travelled all over the US and Europe, so that is saying tons.  We stayed in the "new" poolside rooms.  The rooms are now trashed, scratched floors, chipped paint, stained carpets in the hallways.  The pool is now open to any random person who comes in and gets a drink at the bar.  After the randoms leave the pool, the lounge chairs are left dirty and nobody is there to clean up.  I thought we could get some pool time in during the AM with other real guests of the hotel, but both mornings (Friday and Saturday), work men were trimming the palm trees around the pool!  My lovely swim was covered with palm tree sawdust.  Coming back to the hotel at night (after 2am), I had drunk random people pushing me as I tried to pass by the pool to my room.  Sad that the Roosevelt has to be so desperate to make money.  Oh, and no free internet???  Seriously?	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-08-16	4	Overall, It's a great place to stay, but there were a few minor problems, [...]. The room itself was Okay, not the best but Okay, for a junior suite, you have a huge walk-in closet, but the bathroom was really tiny, especially for a suite, it kinda makes you question about how they utilize the space in the hotel. Our air conditioner did not work, We had to call someone from Engineering to come and fix it, it was the circuit breaker located in our closet that was turned off, that controlled the air conditioner.It was really noisy in the room, due the party / dj / club scene downstairs by the pool. I am thinking to myself, what if we upgraded to a room by the pool.After checking out, it took me and wife awhile for us to get our car from the valet, even though I called ahead of time. It was interesting, we were waiting in the front, I already handed my ticket to a person and we noticed our car parked in the front. It took more than 15 min to finally realize the person in the suit had our keys the whole time, no one informed us.Overall, my experience was good nor bad, some improvements could be made or done, but historic landmark with a great view.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-04-20	1	I am a married, adult law student in my mid 30s, and I stayed at The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel on my recent trip to L.A. -newline-  -newline- The reason for my trip was twofold. I was to have a meeting with my new business partner and friend regarding the company we just started. Also, I have 4 very old and dear buddies that I went to college with who live in Hollywood as well, and I hoped to combine a business trip with pleasure by reconnecting with them over cocktails. -newline-  -newline- This was to be a very special occasion for both myself and my old pals as none of us had seen each other in many years. After college I went away to law school while they moved off to the west coast to chase dreams, and now that we've all become successful in those pursuits we were eager to sit around and swap our respective stories and I'd hoped to provide the hosting location via what I thought would be a swanky hotel with an atmosphere that the entire group could appreciate. -newline-  -newline- To give you an idea of the group's make-up, I'll just say that two of my friends are now working for two of the major broadcast networks in executive positions where they work in the production of two different prime time TV shows, and the rest are successfully established in the music business, so all of us had tons of exciting stories to tell and were excited to get together for the purpose of doing so. Consequently, I was looking for a hotel that could offer us a hip, centrally located spot to meet/eat/drink.  I also wanted to stay somewhere that had tons of amenities, gorgeous architecture, and a rich history. I must admit that if these were the only criteria that mattered, The Roosevelt would've certainly more than fit the bill. -newline-  -newline- Ironically, all of us had plenty of money to spend on expensive food and beverage service which is exactly what I was in the market for, but sadly the behavior of the Roosevelt's staff forced us to spend it elsewhere. In general the employees at The Roosevelt were so unbelievably rude, unhelpful, and inexplicably conceited that their lack of professionalism and total absence of anything approaching hospitable service, ended up rendering the property basically unusable as anything more than a place for me to sleep at night. Considering my experience, if I had it to do over I'd have taken up one of the many offers to stay in a friend's guest room in lieu of ever entering this hotel. Typically I am the kind of person who is uncomfortable with such an imposition even with close friends and family, but that kind of experience would have been far more comfortable than any of the time I spent on The Roosevelt's property. -newline-  -newline- I was surprised to find that after ten p.m. (and often during the day as well), there was no way possible to ingress or egress from my particular room without encountering a rude, snarky, and accusatory member of the hotel security staff. Security at The Roosevelt, apparently, consists of well-dressed gentlemen with secret-service-style earpieces whose job it is to interrogate guests as to where they are going each time they leave or return to their rooms while simultaneously making sure they don't feel comfortable anywhere near the pool bar area. -newline-  -newline- The first day I was there, after checking in and going out to have some dinner, I returned to the hotel with 3 friends. Our plan was to stop by my room to drop some things off, then we were going to head to the bar at the pool for a bit. Unfortunately, our plans changed after the glorified hall monitor on duty insisted that he search each of the bags that each of us were carrying as if we were common criminals attempting to smuggle narcotics through customs or something. He explained to me, after finding a single bottle of alcohol that I had purchased on our way back, that the hotel had a policy against "outside alcohol", and that this was "typical policy at most hotels". Having previously managed an oceanfront resort, I found that information surprising, but I totally complied without so much as politely que...	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-04-08	4	Hotel is very cool but very weird.  Reminded us of a David Lynch movie set.  Dark and moody.  We did get lost a few times in the hotel.  Loved our stay. We stayed in a Cabana Room that overlooks the pool.  We had a balcony view of the pool and Tropicana Bar.  Only complaint would be that the room was very dark (not enough lighting) and we had to track down ice (no ice machine on our floor even though the hotel directory said their was ice on each floor).  We ended up going to the bar to get ice and were told we have to call front desk and have ice delivered to our room.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-03-10	5	It was a fabulous stay!  Our primary reason for visiting LA was to see Oprah's After Oscar Show at the Kodak theater.  To make things easier, we wanted to stay close.  After reviewing numerous hotels in the area, the Roosevelt seemed to be the best choice.  The staff was super friendly and offered an Oscar Viewing Party in the historical lobby on the first day.  The service was great and we had a wonderful time.  I would highly recommend this hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-02-14	2	The hotel itself was nice, but I rather stay at a Holiday in because they at least don't charge you for every little thing. For how much I paid I should have gotten at least free WiFi. The room was very small and I couldn't even order movies on the tv. I was kinda disappointed because I was told that it was a good hotel.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-01-23	4	Some "cabana rooms" are overlooking a street and the Hotel chose to have the windows frosted. My husband and I asked to be moved to a room with a clear window. The staff was helpful and we ended up in a cabana room with balcony overlooking the pool, which was great! We enjoyed drinking our coffee in the morning in our private balcony above the pool. The only thing to note is that the pool bar is a trendy bar so it plays loud music until 2AM in the weekends. Not family friendly but it didn't bother us. All in all, a good hotel with a good location if you choose the room that fits your style. We will probably stay there again in the future.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-01-22	4	I've stayed at the Roosevelt over six times in the past few months, and find it a great place to stay for business.  The fittness center is small, clean, well equipped and almost always empty. If you work out in the morning, often there is a pot of fresh coffee outside the fittness center at the ready. I always stay in the cabana rooms (either garden or pool view)which are decent sized and sound-proofed much better than other hotels in the same price/sytle category.  If you stay in the cabana rooms on a Thursday/Friday/Saturday evening during good weather and are looking for a quiet getaway, the poolside rooms aren't for you as the Tropicana Bar is often booked for events which can last well into the early hours.  The garden view rooms, however, are always quiet as they face residential blocks of Hollywood. -newline- The staff at the Roosevelt is always friendly and accomodating, even if they do not recognize you as a return guest.  The valets and door staff, on the other hand, are some of the best!  They are incredibly personable and professional.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-01-21	1	Web site was misleding on size of room. I needed to have space for meetings and had to upgrade at an additional $125per night to do so. -newline-  -newline- There always seemed to be a party going on in the hallways and I had to listen to a flute player practice for quite some time one evening. -newline-  -newline- Staff that led you away from activites in the lobby were not rude, but a bit forcefull. Made me feel like it was my fault the lobby was closed. -newline-  -newline- Bathroom layout is poor and the old tub is very slippery. The glass partition is the only thing to try and catch yourself. -newline-  -newline- I could understand the high parking price if your not a guest. -newline-  -newline- Maintenace had to drill out the door in order to get me in my room. Then they had to come back and replace lockset. I was offered another room, but it was the small king that I had just upgraded from. -newline-  -newline- I would have thought that after sitting in the hallway waiting for maintenance to let me in and then being distrubed again while they re-installed a new lockset that some form of compensation would have been offered...none was.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2010-01-20	2	While I loved staying in the middle of Hollywood, I was very disappointed with the Roosevelt Hotel.  The furniture in my upgraded "suite" was falling apart and the iPod dock clock radio was completely out of commission.  If I'm paying a premium rate for a room I expect a premium experience, this was not the case.  Look to The Standard.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-12-08	3	We were told by the desk staff when we first arrived that they would do us a favor and upgrade us to a deluxe room from the standard we had paid for, but [...] had verified a Deluxe room already for us.  I didn't say anything about it when they gave us this apparent upgrade.We were let into our room quite early, since occupancy was not all that busy.The room had plenty of space, but nowhere to sit other than the bed and one small desk chair.  When I mentioned this at check-out, the desk person said there certainly should have been additional seating in the room and that when I came the next time, I could ask for more seating if none was provided.  Somehow, it doesn't seem to me that it should be my responsibility to make sure they are providing the proper amenities in their rooms.  I was not offered any compensation for the inconvenience we endured by the lack of seating in the room.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-12-02	5	An amazing hotel, right in the heart of Hollywood Boulevard, the lobby is amazing (I'm told Shirley Temple learned to tap dance on the tiles steps there!) and the food at the cafe, 25 degrees was awesome, open 24 hours. Conscierge and Reception extremely helpful, the room contemporary and suited our needs. The only thing we can fault was that they charged extra for internet usage - but we found we could go to the coffee shop across the street to use it for free!! Parking was pricey, but understandable in this location. Roosevelt Certainly the accommodation highlight of our trip.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-11-17	4	It was a very stylish hotel in an excellent location.  We enjoyed our stay.  The only negatives are that nothing is really included in your stay except for housekeeping.  You must pay to park your car in the lot, pay to make a local phone call, pay to do anything really.  The drinks at the Tropica were very expensive.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay because of the location and history of the hotel.  If I ever return to LA, I will probably stay at one of the beaches.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-10-25	4	I live in LA, bf does not, and wanted to spend a full day/late night in Hollywood.  Great way to "experience" Hollywood by staying the night at The Roosevelt.  It's a Hollywood landmark (don't let the outside fool you~ even though I LUV the old hotel sign, esp  at night). -newline- Considered The Renaissance, Marriott across the street @ Hollywood & Highland (same price range), but it's more for those in town w/ fam, business, or staying longer than a weekend.  The Roosevelt crowd is 25-35, single, trendy, and a little bit "vegas".  Also, considered The Standard off Sunset, but friends gave poor reviews  (not to be mistaken for The Standard, downtown LA, very good reviews).  Only thing about location for The Roosevelt is it's not on Sunset strip, but there's taxis on stand-by, so nbd.  Valet prkg a MUST, and yes it's about $30/day, but consider the location, that's normal for ANY hotel in a major downtown city. -newline- Recommend a room w/ poolside view (not what we got b/c we wanted a lil' privacy but fun for people-watching & being up in the "mix").  Bathrooms are small, ours only had half a shower door (that was the "look", suppose to be modern?), tight fit for 2 in shower, no counter-space (had to do make-up/hair on floor in front of full length mirror).  Hotel has 24hr room service (limited menu but theres a 24hr burger joint downstairs), and minibar (but stock ur own supply for obvious rea$on$). -newline- We were cheesy and did an ALL-morning "Grand Tour" LA tour (via Starline tours).  I ended up liking it b/c my bf got to see ALL of the important sites (HW Bowl, Kodak Theatre, Chinese Theater, Rodeo Drive, La Brea Tar Pits, Olvera St, Farmer's Market/the Grove, Disney Music Hall, etc.) w/out relying on me to get him there (plus, I don't know the "history/facts" like the tour guide).  It picked us up across the street at the Graumann's Chinese theater so we valet our car early in the morning (8am) and hotel held our bags until we were ready to check in later (tour ended about 2-3p).  You spend about 20mins at each location &  if we wanted we could drive back to a spot that we liked afterwards (nothing's really too far from hotel).  It's about $60pp but still worth it one time, esp for those who aren't from LA.  And I've been to those places many times but still ended up learning or seeing something I never knew. -newline- Before going out at night, I recommend having cocktails around the bar areas at The Roosevelt, very loungy-feel.  If staying on a friday nite have dinner at Cafe WAS b/c (Ivan Kane's) 40 Deuces closed in Hollywood about 2yrs ago and Cafe WAS now has the girls on fri nites (burlesque dancers~ the sexiest ones in LA area), there's 2 shows.  You don't need to have dinner to see girls (but good luck having a view at the bar).  Get a good spot and make a dinner reservation.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-10-19	2	Everything was ok until we opened the door.  Three people were in the room.  They said they were just showing the room.  I can't see why, rug worn and dirty looking, worn furniture, too sterile and spartan.  Room full of "stuff" to buy.  Even the morning coffee you make your self was $3.50 a cup. -newline- We'll never return.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-10-19	4	Historic building centrally located to all Hollywood sights, venues, shopping, dining and clubs.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-10-16	1	My husband and I traveled across I-10 from FL to CA & stayed at 3 B&B's, 2 Super 8's & the Roosevelt.  THE WORST exp. was by far the Roosevelt, where we were told there were no reservations (staff blamed [...], or anyone else they could for the "error"), denied access to our vehicle and pointed to areas we wanted to see (the pool, the Marilyn mirror on 2nd floor, lounge).  I was told that the confirmation that I printed would not do me any good, as I was trying to show it to the desk clerk to let her know that we did indeed have reservations.  We prepaid for two weekend nights and one weekday night, excluding tips and parking, and the clerk handed us a charge summary which included the very day we were checking out, which we had already paid for but were told was not reserved for us.  We asked to speak to a manager and were told that the manager was on the phone so we would have to wait.[...]the last evening, which is the Roosevelt's responsibility, is still not refunded to my credit card, and that was five days ago.  Had we flown into CA to spend the entire stay there, our vacation would have been ruined.  The stars of the show were the lowly bellhops, valets and housekeeping staff who were all gracious and helpful.Also, everything is charged....no complimentary coffee, water or parking.  I'm surprised they don't charge for the toilet paper useage.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-10-04	4	Let me start by saying that this was an amazing hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking to stay on the strip. But there are a few things you should know before you book. [...] you have one and only one option when it comes to parking your car; valet, that's it, no self parking. What you are not told when you book is that it's 30 dollars a night‚Ä¶!!! Why this is not included in the room price I'm not sure but it was not very cool. My last and final word of advice is that the Hotel bar (Paradise pool bar) is WAY, WAY ,WAY overpriced. I ordered two drinks (7&7 and a Gin & Tonic) and was charged 30, yes you read that right, 30 dollars!!! A bottle from the room fridge was 32 dollars. Not to mention it was the worst 7&7 and Gin & Tonic I have ever tasted in my life. Not sure how you can screw up a drink that has two ingredients but this bartender managed to do so. My wife and I ended up going up the street to the Pig & Whistle and had a blast. I highly recommend ditching the overpriced hotel bar and hit the P&W. Like I said at the start of this review, the Hotel is a great place to stay, just not to park or drink.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-09-13	3	Hotel itself has a very cool ambiance - almost too cool.  The staff seems to be composed of 20 something year old actor wannabes.  I often felt that I was inconveniencing them with any requests (probably wasting their time from which they could otherwise be self obsessing or discussing their latest head shots).  I had a pair of subscription sunglasses mysteriously disappear from the pool bar.  All my requests to please look in the lost and found were denied.  I was simply told that no sunglasses were found at that specific time or at that specific location.  This clearly would preclude the possibility of the sunglasses either being turned in at a different time or found at a different location.  As I have a strong disbelief that there is a market for stolen one year old prescription glasses, I am sure the glasses are still at the hotel (most likely in the lost and found) but the staff is otherwise too preoccupied to retrieve them.  Of course, the other possibility is that the hotel attracts unsavory visitors that would stoop to the level of stealing used prescription glasses.  Either way, I would have been better off staying someplace else where at which guests are appreciated and staff can take the time to accommodate them.  Hotel stay ended up costing me the price of having to replace the glasses; almost two times as much as the cost of my stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-09-09	4	Excellent choice in the Hollywood, West Hollywood, Beverley Hills area. I selected the Roosevelt for it's location. Fact is most anything else is the same or much more money. The A/C is a little noisy if you are a light sleeper you will hear it come on many times in the night. The service is excellent and right at the top for places I've stayed. My only complaint is the cost to park my car equaled what it cost to rent, $30 per day/ night. Great stay overall and I would recommend it with Orbitz's deals.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-09-08	2	The lobby, library bar, and main restaurant have a lovely old Hollywood decadence that is very attractive, given the hotel's location.  The proximity to various Hollywood tourist sites is excellent.  Unfortunately, parts of the hotel are periodically off limits to hotel guests, due to private functions, and that occurred frequently enough during our two day stay to prove quite irritating.  The pool experience is unique, more akin to performance art than sunning and swimming.  Being a hotel guest didn't seem to provide much advantage as far as getting seated around the pool, and the surcharge of $20/hotel guest for use of the pool area on Sunday afternoon seemed unreasonable.  The real blemish on the experience was the noisiness of the hotel at night.  There was a party being held in the room next to hours on one of the two nights we were there that went into the wee hours and made sleeping impossible.  By and large, the hotel appears to cater too, and be patronized by, a 20 something crowd, who mostly seemed very nice, but whose collective idea of having a good time was a little hectic for our more middle aged sensibilities.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2009-06-01	4	Despite all the negative reviews I read online about the Roosevelt, I found it to be simply wonderful. We had a beautiful suite, received first-class service from check in to valet to poolside waitstaff and more. We did not eat at the hotel nor drink at any of the bars, mainly due to us having other obligations away from the hotel. We did want to get a night cap on Saturday evening but decided to do so in the our room. The pool bar and other lounges were full of 20 somethings sloppy drunk and obnoxious. I have to say the only two things really keeping my review from being 5 star is location, that part of Hollywood is VERY run down and way too touristy. The second being the non-guests of the hotel that come to use the pool and bars. Young pretentious people only wanting to see and be seen and with WAY more attitude than class.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2008-11-30	4	This was my first stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt. We were very much looking forward to our stay.          Check-in went very amoothly and the lady at the front desk was very pleasant. We were then told that we had been upgraded to a cabana balcony room. These are rooms overlooking the swimming pool, and the view is indeed very nice. However, our room wss small and very dark. The furnishings are very stylish. There are no rugs or carpets on the hardwood floors, and apart from the bed there is really no place else to sit. Another drawback is the fact that these rooms are facing a poolside nightclub, and the music and noise level of the crowd keeps on until about 1:00 a.m. Again, the front desk didn't mention this when we checked in.          One more comment; I took our car out of valet the next day to go shopping, and tipped the valet attendant $5.00. I thought this was pretty reasonable, since he had driven our car about thirty feet from where it was parked. Oh well, I guess it is Hollywood, after all.           Before leaving, there were two charges to my room that I had to dispute. It seems thta someone ordered 2 beers from the poolside bar and charged them to my room (I don't drink). All in all, i would be reluctant to recommend this hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2008-10-10	5	We stayed at the Roosevelt and it was awesome.  The staff was extremely helpful.  My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary and they upgraded us from the room that we were in to a Cabana room by the pool.  The room itself was small, but the had a great balcony and view of the pool.  On top of that, the location of this hotel could not have been better.  It is right in the middle of Hollywood with the Grauman's Chinese Theater half a block away.  My only complaint was that they offered spa services but did not have an actual spa, but charged premium prices.  Your options for a massage were to have a massage in your room, by the pool or in their massage room.  None of which were ideal.  If the massage was at the pool, there was no privacy.  If it was in the massage room, the room itself was semi-private with 3 massage tables and on the back side of the hotel and there was a lot of street noise on that side.  I didn't want a massage in my room because I felt like it wasn't fair to my husband to kick him out.  We ate at 24 degrees and the food was so good and the decor around the hotel was also very cool.  Overall, I would strongly recommend this place again, just don't expect to get a massage.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Outside our room was the roof top with generator fans that we could also hear all night.  We mentioned this to the front desk but didn't get any response from the person on duty so we just bared with it. For the money we expected a quiet and larger room.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2008-03-05	5	The Hotel Roosevelt was very comfortable, the room, although standard size, was very cozy.  It had 2 queen size beds, a desk, 2 chairs.  The bathroom was small but but everything a person would need.  A closet for hanging clothes, an ironing board and iron.  The location was very good--it was within walking distance to a great outside mall, the Chinese Theater and Kodak Theater, next to Jimmy Kimmell Show taping, food shops and such.  Best to take San Diego (405) freeway north from the airport and exit La Cienega  continue traveling north until Sunset Blvd. turn right (east) turn right at In and Out Burger a couple miles down and there you are at a great valet parking.  The staff was great from the valet to the check in housekeeping and room service.  It was a great value.  The lobby is dark and ambient with a throwback of the old Hollywood days. I would definitely stay there again.  It was a very good value but a very nice hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2008-03-04	5	I stayed here because my daughter had a function at the Kodak.  Very much in the middle of all the Hollywood action.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating.  The Dakota steak house is highly touted and popular.  The smaller cafe, 25 Degrees I believe, was excellent for both breakfast and dinner.  The room was comfortable, but the bathroom was a bit small - no real room for makeup, hair dryer and flat iron.  The room did have 2 closets.  Very comfy beds.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-12-10	2	Perfect location for attending movie premieres at Grauman's Chinese Theatre and exploring Hollywood Blvd. Hotel staff are friendly and accommodating, and housekeeping staff greet you by name (even fold your clothes for you if you've left them laying on the bed). Upon checking in I asked for a quiet room as I'm a light sleeper, and front desk kindly upgraded me to a Superior Queen room, which gives you about an extra six feet of space--would have hated to see how small the other rooms were. Several large celebrity type magazines are in the room (very nice). While the first night was mostly quiet, the next two were not--lots of private events are held on the first and second floors of the hotel and you not only only hear the loud music, but the floor was even vibrating one night. Beds are very comfortable, lots of pillows and a quilt. Bathroom is small, but adequate with thick towels. Ice is delivered in late-afternoon by housekeeping (nice touch). TV is old and needs to be replaced.   However, twice I asked that the showerhead and bathtub drain be fixed (shower needed new washer, water spraying all over tile, and the bathtub was draining very slowly). I left a note with the front desk and second time alerted them verbally and nothing was ever done.   Didn't find out until my last day that there are two laptops and a printer for guests' use on the other side of the check-in area (this is not in their hotel info binder in the rooms), so I didn't waste time reading my e-mail.  My friend was staying on the 12th floor in a suite, and she had a couple of bathrobes (however, her carpet was stained, as was mine, furniture fabric was fraying here and there, but she had two large flat-screen TVs). Both of us said that the hotel needs to replace carpets where stained and replace/reupholster furniture for the prices they are charging.   I would stay here again as the location is perfect and safe, hotel staff are friendly (even if you are not a VIP/celebrity--plenty of industry people staying at hotel).	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-11-20	2	Everything was good at this location, but I managed to miss my flight and I blame the hotel.  The clock in the room was one hour slow.  I understand that Housekeeping has a lot to do, but that should be a standard to check.  I checked out and got in the car and realized it was an hour later than had stated in the room.  I missed my flight and caused a burden on getting home.      Pretty poor for a hotel of high standards.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-09-29	4	The location of the roosvelt hotel is excellent, right on the hollywood street, near the Kodark theater and Chinese theater. Room is clean, staff are nice, the only thing is that the bed is kinda too soft, which might make ur waist pain a little bit. Excellent swimming pool and fitting room, and a very nice bar there. Hotel rate is a little high, however, considering the location, it is understandable.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-09-04	5	Stayed 6 nights had a great time.The upgraded our room to two double queens at no extra cost.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-08-01	5	My first time at The Roosevelt Hotel was quite the stay.  It was my birthday, and I must say I did feel like a star in Hollywood.  The room was modern and chic.  The Dining options were delicious and amazing.  I was pretty disappointed though when  the pool was out of service due to an event when I checked in.  And that's what I looked the most forward to.   Other than that, I enjoyed my fun stay at the Roosevelt!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-08-01	5	This hotel was great, the check in staff were extremely helpful i was impressed off the start. We stayed for 4 nights, our room was spacious the bathroom was adorable.  The Fresh product they used in the bathroom was great I wish i knew where to find it.  Bellhop was very informative.  check out was quick and easy. Right across the street from kodak theater, the Hollywood and highland center graumans Chinese theater, we have a perfect view of the Hollywood Sign. Only complaint really was there was no top sheet on the bed which was odd but they washed the duvet every day, which probably isn't to good for the environment.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-07-28	4	The overall hotel was spectacular, the staff welcomed us back every time we walked through the door.  The pool is a great late night hot spot and was packed both nights we stayed. My only complaint is that the rooms were quite small.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-07-26	2	The Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles is a trip back in time and place . The 1923 era  hotel is a mix of old and new , it's as if high tech meets the '20's. Young and affluent ipod people, chicly apparelled wandering amongst the high ceiling , elegantly restored hotel.       The Hotel has a beautiful pool with surrounding rooms creating a cabana-like feel. It is very pleasant to relax there , drink in hand ,  moments from the congested streets of Hollywood right outside. An oasis that is nice to come back to at the end of the day.     The counter-point to the pool scene is the main lobby.  The dark cavernous entry  is quite strange, huge , and very dark with over-sized furniture scattered about.  Another  oddity   is the perplexing floor design that  connects the mezzanine and the lobby floors. I got  lost on more than one occasion leaving the elevators and trying to find my way out.    The twenty-something staff seemed to be in a training mode . Right outside the hotel is , well Hollywood , and  that means tourists, landmarks, people watching and shopping. A great location to go to the Hollywood bowl , shop ,  beach , etc.     All in all , a great place to do LA.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-07-16	5	The Hollywood Roosevelt was a great place to stay right in the middle of Hollywood Blvd.  Close to the Metro and a one-stop ride to the Pantages.  Staff were very helpful and courteous.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-07-05	2	The hotel service was excellent. But it was a constant battle to get into the hotel via the entrance because of non hotel guests coming to the hotel with their cars. At times it was dangerous with them trying to exit the hotel through the entrance driveway and in turn their rude and foul language when it was brought to their attention. I am fully aware of the increased popularity of the hotel but there should be some control on non hotels guests   wandering throughout the lobby drunk and not being dressed appropriately.I believe this hotel has a lot of potential and could be a  destination spot for a select clientele if there was much more quality control.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel		2007-06-19	5	My stay at the Roosevelt was great, however, I just wanted to relax by their great pool but they had a huge pool party and there was no room to sit, and it certainly wasn't relaxing.  Great hotel with a lot of character.  I will definitely stay there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">7000 Hollywood Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2014-04-24	1	Prior to booking at this hotel I called to ensure they had conjoining rooms with 2 double beds each. I was told yes on the phone but upon arrival I was told they did not have this - only rooms with 1 King bed conjoined to a room with 2 double beds. I arrived at 3pm (which is the listed check in time) but rooms were not available until 4:45. Very disappointing!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>
Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2014-04-19	4	We've stayed here twice because it's location to Hollywood and the normal tourist stuff is great.

Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2014-04-19	3	The location of this hotel is excellent for down town Burbank, The hotel is in dire need of a refurb that was just commencing as I left, hopefully this will also be for the lifts and certain common areas that are most undesirable Once the refurbishment is complete I think it would be quite a pleasant place to stay	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>
Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2014-03-17	4	The whole set up was good. Great restaurants and bars a block away. Our only issue was a cork screw. It used to be almost every hotel had a cork screw in the room. Went to ask bartender for one. It was one of those plastic cheap ones with Holiday Inn on it with phone number...obviously for advertisement. Said I had to bring it back, they are $1.00 at most liquor stores. I offered to buy it. Nope have to bring it back...anyway, not a big deal just funny they don't give them away. My fault in the end for not bring one of the dozens and dozens we have from past excursions. I would go back again for sure.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>
Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2014-03-08	4	Stayed here because of it's location to the Superior Court on Olive. The room accommodations and the business center availability reduced that stress factor which in turn contributed to our success in court. -newline- I would give the hotel high marks as a good place to stay during high pressure or stressed business situations.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>
Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2014-03-04	1	I thought this hotel would be a nice stay since we saw that the hotel received three stars but we were so wrong. The front desk employees were rude and not friendly at all. The hotel surroundings were old and stale. During our stay, it rained the whole time so there were buckets around the hotel for the leaks. The leaks were mainly in the elevators which smelled like mildew. Also the visitors left trash outside of their hotel doors which took days for someone to pick up. Overall we did NOT have a wonderful experience at Holiday Inn.

Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2013-08-06	2	Unfortunately they gave me a smoking room. I've asked for a different room but the hotel was completely booked. It looks like one of the room they usually use for the staff and they gave out only because they were out of rooms. The room smelt of smoke a lot and also the bed. -newline- We asked 3 times for some spray to refresh the room before someone came to our room. -newline- The smell on the bed was bad. -newline- Probably we were unlucky but the front desk staff were really unpleasant.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>

Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2013-05-14	5	This hotel was perfect for our 4-night stay! It included parking and free wifi connection which was important to us because other hotels would charge for parking per day as well as for Internet connection. I also liked how this hotel was surrounded by the views of the mountains and how it sits in the downtown area of the city of Burbank. The staff was nice and was able to accomodate to our needs efficiently. Overall, I would recommend this hotel and possibly choose it for our future stay in Burbank, CA.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>
Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2012-12-24	1	Well let me start off by fully admitting I'm giving this hotel a poor rating for an event that ultimately is my fault, but I believe others may benefit from being warned. During a recent Christmas shopping trip, I stayed overnight at this Holiday Inn in Burbank based upon the recommendation of a friend. Upon retiring for the night, I dumped the contents of my purse, including receipts, credit cards, cash, medicine and checkbook in the nightstand drawer. Sadly, I also placed my wedding set and other jewelry in the drawer too. When I checked-out, I neglected to remove my things and didn't realize it until today. Upon calling back to the hotel front desk, I was told the only items turned in by the maid were a checkbook, medicine, and a credit card (conveniently things no one else can safely use/sell). The hotel staff seemed VERY uninterested in my loss and/or the implication. I have filed police and insurance reports but I‚Äôm surprised that Holiday Inn would be so nonchalant about having a thief as an employee. Outside of the five-figure loss, the hotel was okay. If this comes to a happy resolution, I will update the review.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>
Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2012-11-05	4	My stay at the Holiday Inn-Burbank Media Center was great except that when we went to check in we were told that the rooms we booked through the online travel company were oversold and that they didn't have any rooms availalble for us. The manager had to scramble to find us 2 rooms and tried to give us standard beds even though we asked for King size beds. It took about 30 minutes to get everything sorted out but nonetheless a bit of an inconvenience. The rooms are very spacious, quiet (can't hear anyone above you) and clean although they could do some updating with the carpet and paint. They have a few restaurants onsite which are also very good and they offer free parking. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall, I would definitely stay there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>
Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2012-09-25	1	Worst hotel I've ever stayed in... Location was great but the staff was horrible! Asked nicely if we can upgrade to a suite for a bigger space, to have a bigger room to get ready for a wedding the next day, but flatly said no right away without even Checking if there's -newline- Any room available... Im willing to pay for it but the way they answered was really rude and customer service was bad...We dealt with it and went straight to this old room... Bathroom had too much lights that can blind someone... Then requested for some chairs to be brought up to our room so when we start our hair and make up session so people can sit but said they have no chairs!!! Really?!' can't we borrow from the hall with 300 chairs? Flatly said no! I really -newline- Should've checked in to residence inn Marriott instead...

Not only was the staff accommodating and understanding,the hotel was gorgeous! I was expecting the Holiday Inn to be a 3 star (max) hotel but after arriving,the place was stunning. I loved how it is conveniently across the street from local bars/restaurants like BJ's. This is definitely placed in a great location. Overall,I think I just might have to stay with the Holiday Inn whenever I'm in LA.Completely satisfied:)))	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>

Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2012-05-19	3	The hotel staff were great and everything was super clean inside. The airport shuttle was always on time and the drivers were very friendly and safe. The food was excellent for hotel room service and dining. The furniture was sad though. It needs replacing. The bed was a slab with a quitted topped and the chairs all had deep wear making them less than comforable. The bathroom was tiny. I stubbed my toe three times trying to just move around to use it. The shower head was so low I had to neel to wash my hair and the warmest the water ever got was body temperature. I paid extra for a room with a view. What I did not know was that my view would be the parking garage and them into my room. Not that it matter because the windows were so filthy that you could hardly see out of them. I have certainly stayed in far worse. It fit my need, but I would not choose to return to the same hotel in the same condition for the same price.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>

Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2011-10-10	3	The staff was extremely helpful and friendly the minute we (we had 2 rooms) checked in until check out 2 days later. The entire hotel including the rooms were very clean but in dire need of updating. The room is not set up for business travelers. The desk doesnt' even have plugs for phones, computers, etc. The bathroom counter is very small and the lighting was so bright/harsh I felt blinded. The upside is there are many restaurants and shopping within walking distance. I would return if the hotel underwent renovations.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>

The hotel restaurant could be better in terms of items offered, but the staff was great.  Other than those aspects, this location also offers a fitness center, pool, and business office center - none of which I had the need or time to use this time around.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>
Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2009-05-03	4	I went to Burbank to visit friends. Found the Hotel clean, friendly staff, centrally located. -newline- The rooms were only slightly updated, but clean. The beds were comfortable, the view from my room was great. -newline- My only complaint was the wireless service was so-so. When I called the front desk, they offered little help. Otherwise, a great experience. I will definitely consider this Hotel again in the future.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>

Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2008-09-29	5	This hotel provided a great stay, the staff was very helpful and great to deal with. But the location was the best part of this hotel, within a 15 min (Town) driving distance to many attractions...NBC & WB Studios, Hollywood, and Universal Studios. Free covered parking was another big plus.       I would highly recommend this hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>
Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2008-09-02	5	The Holiday Inn Burbank Media Center was a pleasant surprise.I booked what I thought was just a cheap hotel,but was shocked to see what a fabulous place it really was.The only thing bad I have to say is that I could not get room service after 10:pm.But thinking about it now,I could have gone to any of a dozen or so restaurants located on every and any street around the hotel.There is a nice place just across the street where they make their own beer that I would highly recommend.The hotel room was very good sized and I had a good view of the back side of the mountain that has the HOLLYWOOD sign on it from the 8th floor.I forgot to unpack my bag the first night.Thats OK,there was an iron and board in the room.Along with a fridge,a coffee maker,hair dryer,toiletries,free coffee and tea stuff.It was fantastic!The hotel was staff was courteous and friendly,very helpful.The 3 star rating does not do justice.Should probably be 4.Now talk about location.I mentioned the Hollywood sign,less than 30 minutes around the mountain.Disney Studios,NBC,CBS,Universal,just a few minutes away.Literally 2 or 3 miles.Thats it!Dodger Stadium,The Rose Bowl,10 or 15 minutes.Any thing you want to do is right there.And smack dab in the middle is the Holiday Inn Burbank Media Center.A great place to stay!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>
Holiday Inn BURBANK-MEDIA CENTER		2008-03-31	5	The staff at the Holiday Inn Burbank was very accomodating.  They tried try best to make our needs met.  For example, I had 2 rooms. One for me and my children and one for grandma.  Orginially, I wanted connected/adjacent rooms.  This could not be arranged. Although, the Holiday Inn staff did make sure that our rooms were on the same floor. Having grandma close to me and my children is a priority, when we travel.  Also, I throughly enjoyed that all Holiday Inn staff was friendly; from the Bellhop, registration desk, housekeeping staff and parking attendant.  It was a pleasure to hear good morning fromm all and receive that friendly smile each day and evening.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>

The quality of the food was great and quantity...usually more than you could eat.      There was a large mall within walking distance and many unique shops along the street leading to the mall.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">150 EAST ANGELENO, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">BURBANK</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91502</span>

The room was clean and very comfortable. The pool and pool area area are both very nice. The standard room are not very spacious but the huge bathroom and balcony made up for it.

The Beverly Hilton		2014-01-25	4	When we went to dinner at Trader Vic's in the hotel, we came back to find our keys didn't work. It took about 20 minutes for someone to come and open the door, and we were stuck in the freezing hallway waiting. -newline-  -newline- The room was also extremely small. I actually couldn't believe they fit a bathroom in there. And there was no DVD player. -newline-  -newline- That being said, when I asked for things to be delivered to the room -- robes, plates -- the service was very prompt.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>

The Beverly Hilton		2013-11-17	3	GREAT location - decent value but a bit long in the tooth. The hallway carpets are a bit worn and the rooms have seen better days. Don't get me wrong - they're clean and acceptable - but a bit like spending the night in your grandmothers OLD house.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>
The Beverly Hilton		2013-10-12	2	1. I arrived at the hotel after a 14 hour flight and very tired, the air-conditioning unit in the room was louder than the airplane engines on the aircraft. -newline- 2. The bathroom was the size of a small 2 star hotel albeit, the shower was hot and water pressure great. -newline- 3. The telephone next to the bed did not operate/work. -newline- 4. I had breakfast vouchers (breakfast included in cost of stay). On check out I found one breakfast on my bill - I explained that I had vouchers and the reception removed the cost from the overall bill. And yet, three days after leaving the hotel, I find that the Hilton charged my Visa card for a breakfast. -newline- 5. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE HILTON TO ANYONE and anyone I speak to about the trip will be told what a sub standard hotel it is considering what was once a very reputable hotel. -newline- 6. For anyone that does stay there, the breakfast is fantastic. -newline- 7. Check your bills on leaving and watch your credit card bills for anything the Hilton charges after leaving.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>

The Beverly Hilton		2013-10-02	4	The Beverly Hilton is very nice; no question! The rooms are classy but not at the level of, say, the Beverly Wilshire, which is much more expensive.

The hotel is very beautiful, but room is nice but a bit too small. But the maid service is not good, did not replace the used towel & rug after took away. The policy of the hotel not to remove the drinks in the refrigerator or will charge for cleaning, is far too much, because there is no space at all for guest to put anything in the refrigerator.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>

The Beverly Hilton		2011-09-14	5	It was my second stay at the Beverly Hilton and this time around it was even better. The day after my arrival I noticed the air conditioning in my room was exceptionally too loud to bear even in the day time (unbearable at night) so the front desk manager gave me a complementary upgrade to a deluxe room in the newly renovated adjacent tower. I was thrilled. Every staff member is courteous and eager to please you in every way possible. The location is super central. There is a bus stop right down the street on Wilshire Blvd where I took the bus to go to West Hollywood and Hollywood for fun every day. The bus runs every 10 minutes and the fare is only $1.50: big savings compared to taxi fares. There is a Starbucks right around the corner and Rodeo Drive is just a few walking blocks away. It's the perfect place to stay. I highly recommend it!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>

The Beverly Hilton		2010-10-05	3	We thought that the rooms would be more spacious and elegent, by the number of stars it got. However, the rooms were very blase, if not sub-par.

The Beverly Hilton		2010-09-12	3	We had a great time, but I feel that I could not do anything in the hotel as it was so expensive, from $30 breakfasts to $10 bottles of water.

It was perfect for this purpose since the pool lounge chaises were so comfortable and the poolside service was prompt and friendly. The food and drinks were delicious.

The Beverly Hilton		2010-06-30	1	The location of the Hotel was great for distance to shopping.  The Hotel itself was not impressive.  We rented a car for our visit so that we could drive down the PCH.  Upon arriving at the Hotel we were informed that parking would be an additional $29.00 per day.  Unfortunately we did not include that in our budget.  In addition the staff was anything but friendly.  When checking in it seemed as if it was almost a bother for them to take care of us.  When we inquired about a particular restaurant the young man checking us in hadn't heard of it and didn't bother to ask any of the other staff if they had.  There were four of us traveling together (all woman)  and when we called housekeeping to order extra towels they told us they would send them up.  They never did.  And we could enjoy breakfast from the room service menu for only $38.00 per person.  A little pricey in my estimation.  All in all we would not stay at this Hotel again.  Wouldn't mind paying the extra money if the service was superb.  Not here.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>

The Beverly Hilton		2010-06-14	4	The location was spectacular, and for the price, unbeatable... [...]  Walking distance to Rodeo Drive, and right in the middle for traveling to business meetings in the area.  The lounge and bar area when you first walk in is very nice for casual business meetings.  Rooms are set up with all the conveniences needed  and comfortable king size beds.

The Beverly Hilton		2010-05-31	4	I've stayed at the Beverly Hilton before for business and was quite impressed with it several years ago, so when I saw such a great price (about $200 per night, all in) for a quick weekend trip to LA I jumped on it.  Overall, it's held up quite well. -newline-  -newline- Service is wonderful, which I expect from this caliber hotel in Beverly Hills.  My husband and I were 20 minutes late for breakfast service and the hostess was nice enough to let us order breakfast anyway, even though the restaurant at Trader Vic's was closed. -newline-  -newline- Rooms are a little on the small side, but very well appointed (outside of our slightly awkward bathroom) and comfortable, including the nice, big, comfy, soft bed and flat screen TV.  The pool area is slightly small, but I like that sort of thing, and has lots of chairs in both sunny and shady areas with very attentive poolside service.  I especially like how the pool is enclosed, so you don't see or hear road traffic and it makes it sort of oasis-like.  Oh, and the gym is awesome.  Nice new equipment, all cardio machines have their own TV, with a well-stocked weights area. -newline-  -newline- It's in a great location, almost within (I say that because no one walks anywhere in LA, even though I'd totally do it) walking distance to Rodeo Drive. -newline-  -newline- All in all, if you have a chance to stay here, do it. Well worth it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>
The Beverly Hilton		2010-05-25	1	Great place but man will you ever pay MORE than you think.  They get you on the small stuff.  $30 a day parking, $15 a day internet, $10 for a bottle of water, etc.  Friendly staff and great facility but don't think you are getting a deal when you book online.  They get you.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>

The Beverly Hilton		2010-05-24	5	Although I have been to L.A. many times, this was the first time for us to go and stay in around the Beverly Hills area.  It's so awesome.  BH, Santa Monica, Hollywood, West Hollywood, Westwood...  It's all so beautiful with lotz see and do.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>
The Beverly Hilton		2010-03-30	5	Overall we were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Everyone knows it by name, but the first impression upon entry wasn't much to see. However, once you enter into the turnabout you get a substantially different image and appreciation of the location. The renovation work in the main entry and common areas was excellent. -newline- We stayed in the Oasis side and not the tower, but we had no problems with the room at a lower cost. -newline- The only drawback was that we should have checked into the event schedule of the hotel, because there was a "Hollywood" event that totally blockedup the entry and also left the parking garage virtually useless for regular hotel guests.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>

The Beverly Hilton		2009-10-27	5	This trip to LA was a birthday gift from my husband. My best friend, Ibolya moved to the city and my husband wanted to cause me a suprise seeing her. -newline- Living in this hotel was an extra luxus, elevating the shine of our stay in LA. -newline- Comparing to other trips, I have to say, this hotel helped our stay keeping the luxury-feeling and the absolut relaxation.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>

The Beverly Hilton		2009-06-22	4	Hotel is in an excellent location both for walking to Rodeo Dr. and for accessing Hollywood and other tourist spots. Rooms are about average size but clean. The maid service was good but not great as they left some trash and forgot to leave the same amount of towels for the room. I'm upset that we booked the room 9 months prior to use and our room was the farthest from the elevator. Parking fees were outrageous costing $28.00 per day. Would I stay there again? Yes.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>
The Beverly Hilton		2009-06-08	2	Re the hotel , -newline- The front man at hotel registration was unable to give me enrollment in the Hilton rewards program and give me frequent flyer credit . He asked me to email him my frequent flyer number from SWest Airlines, even after I gave him my card issued by SWest Airlines.He said it was wrong. -newline- I was charged for 2 nights of parking . I explained to the clerk at checkout I had no car. He then agreed to remove the 2 charges of $34.00 each. -newline- I asked on Saturday to be given a complimentary coffee setup for the room. It never arrived. -newline- The room was fine , I enjoyed the quiet and the atmosphere , and the staff was nice.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>
The Beverly Hilton		2009-06-02	4	It was a nice stay overall.  The hotel staff are very helpful and nice.  One of the guests took my newspaper that was delivered in the morning but that was a minor disappointment.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>
The Beverly Hilton		2009-05-26	4	We booked a junior suite through Orbitz.  A friend recommended we make sure we stay in the newer portion of the hotel (she said it was nicer and had a balcony), and we inquired when we arrived.  We were informed that our reserved junior suite was located in the old tower, and to switch to a junior suite in the new tower would be an additional $75/night.  We checked out the room, and while it was really nice (beautiful bathroom with deep tub & tv, large spacious room, large balcony), it had a poor layout, and looked out onto the hotel rooftop.  We opted for a standard room in the new tower, which  cost an additional $35 a night over our reservation price.  The room was nice, if a little small, with a modern bathroom (no bathtub, unfortunately), a decent size balcony with views of the hills, and a very comfortable bed.  The room was tastefully furnished, clean and modern. -newline-  -newline- The most frustrating aspect of staying at the Beverly Hilton was the fees and expenses.  Parking was $34/night for valet service (which was prompt and offered good service), $10/day for internet access (not particularly fast), and the items in the room's stocked fridge were ridiculously expensive.  $6.50 for a 12 oz bottle of water!  Worse, the fridge is pressure sensitive, so it charges you for anything you move--which makes the in room fridge worthless for keeping your own items cool.  The hotel was willing to pull the items out and make some room upon request, but required a $20 "restocking" fee. -newline-  -newline- This is not an inexpensive place to stay.  Room service was ridiculously expensive ($20 for a continental breakfast), and poolside cocktails were $14.  That said, the service at the hotel was very good, the location is excellent, and the hotel is pretty swank. -newline-  -newline- The extra fee for staying in the newer part of the hotel was a little frustrating.  We pointed out that we had already paid for a junior suite, so moving to a standard room in the new tower shouldn't incur additional expenses.  We were told the hotel's policy was to charge for upgrades to the newer tower for customers who book through travel sites.  He seemed to suggest that regardless of the type of room booked online, the hotel would charge the same upgrade fee: $35 to a standard room/$75 to a junior suite.  I was left with the impression that had we booked a standard room (instead of the junior suite), we still would have paid the same upgrade fee. -newline-  -newline- Although the hotel insisted on applying the upgrade charge, they did waive our entire parking fees, which was essentially the same amount. -newline-  -newline- In sum, we enjoyed our stay at this beautiful and historic hotel.  It isn't cheap, but offers a high level of service, beautiful rooms, and an overall good experience. -newline-  -newline- Pros: Good service, historic hotel, beautiful lobby, good location, really awesome pool. -newline-  -newline- Cons: Lots of additional fees, expenses and surcharges.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>
The Beverly Hilton		2009-04-30	4	I expected a little more of the rooms given the pricing, lobby decor and pool. They were very nice but not FABULOUS. The beds were very comfortable. I had a regular room, I'm sure the suites were much better! Pool area was gorgeous. Unfortunately when I was there it was too cool to go swimming but I would go again just for a chance to swim and lounge in the pool area!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>

The Beverly Hilton		2009-03-04	4	The valet parking service was very friendly, brought you your car with 2 bottles of cold water every time you went out. -newline- Concierge was super, friendly and helpful every time. -newline- The lobby is fantastic with a huge tropical fish tank, tropical birds in cages and lots of plush seating areas. -newline- Trader Vic's lounge was decorated really funky.  Had indoor and outdoor seating by the pool. -newline- The pool area is like a movie star's paradise with gorgeous seating areas and tent topped lounges. -newline- The gift shop is nice, expensive though. -newline- Our room was very nice.  Don't snack at the honor bar!  A little sleeve of Chocolate chip cookies was $10., a can of coke, $6.50.  Nice flat screen TV.  We were on the first floor so there was some traffic noise outside in the morning and a cement block wall outside our window. -newline- The location is great for walking to Sprinkle's cupcakes and Rodeo Drive.  I could afford a cupcake, though not even flip flops on Rodeo Drive...$995. -newline- Take the tour of the stars homes and ask if Richard is driving.  It's a van that picks you up at the hotel, sit in the front seat for excellent photos. -newline- I would definitely go back to The Beverly Hilton!!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>
The Beverly Hilton		2008-11-29	5	The bedroom was beautifully decorated and we liked that there was an extra TV in the bathroom.  The bathroom and shower were particularly modern and lovely.  Don't eat breakfast in the hotel it was overpriced.  The dinner at Cirque 55 in the hotel was delicious and I recommend the restaurant.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>
The Beverly Hilton		2007-04-28	5	The Beverly Hilton was one of the swankest hotels I have ever stayed in and was suprisingly not outrageously priced.  I am a 23 year old college student and was visiting UCLA for a job interview.  A free car took my to and from UCLA and the driver was very friendly and professional.  Sitting by the pool was very relaxing and the pool-side menu was delicious.  Make sure to stop by the hotel lobby bar.  The bartenders are some of the nicest people I have met in LA and were very easy to speak to.  I loved the decor of the hotel and the room I was staying in.  One of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">9876 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Beverly Hills</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90210</span>

Loews Hollywood Hotel		2014-05-27	4	I looked at this hotel reviews in web and found this hotel ot be in the perfect spot, so I wented ahead and booked it. Since I did not drive in LA the location of this Hotel was right next to the Hollywood Highland Metrolink station which made my travel within LA very convenient. I would recommand this Hotel if they are willing to stay connected to Unverisal studio.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

We only ate in the restaurant for breakfast - the food was delicious, although I wouldn't recommend the buffet as it is really overpriced for was they offer. The menu was very reasonably priced though with huge portions. The Lobby Bar might be my new happy place.

Loews Hollywood Hotel		2013-03-27	4	The Loews Hollywood Hotel was in a perfect location to see all the sites in Hollywood. The Walk of Fame was right down the street and it was an easy drive over to Beverly Hills. The hotel was like a little oasis to get away from all the hustle and bustle of all the people on the streets. We got a Jr. Suite which was really big and it had these huge windows that over looked the Dolby Theater and a shopping mall. It had a sleeper sofa that my teenage daughter slept in. was fun to look out at everyone below. The king size bed was so comfortable and the bathroom was very well designed. The shower and toilet was separate from the sink and dressing area. The lobby of the hotel had a bar and Starbucks that was handy. Be careful with the in room mini bar. If you take something out there is a sensor that will automatically charge the item you took out on to your room. There are four spaces that you can use for your own drinks but don't mess with the other spaces or you will get charged for it. We really like the Loews and would for sure stay there again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Loews Hollywood Hotel		2012-06-26	2	Perhaps if we hadn't just come from staying at a 4 star hotel in Huntington Beach where the staff were really friendly and the rooms top class, we may have been more impressed with Renaissance/Loews Hotel Hollywood. As it was, it made a bad impression from the start. The staff behind the desk were indifferent and ignored us, despite the best efforts of our 8 mth old daughter to flirt with them. We were shown to our room which turned out not to have the hollywood sign view we had paid for, or indeed any view at all, unless you count air-conditioning units on nearby roofs. Our bell-boy, Santos, was lovely and organised our room with a view for us plus suggested a fridge for our daughter's bottles. -newline-  -newline- The room was large and clean but the beds were small, hardly Queen size and the bathroom was out dated and small. -newline-  -newline- The next evening, returning late to our room after a long day, we found ourselves locked out. Upon enquiring at the desk, we were told that we had been checked out, they had no record of our 2nd night booking and wouldn't take our word for it, asking us for "proof". We had to bring down a print out of the original booking and there was no apology even when my husband expressed his displeasure. He was so annoyed by this stage that he asked to see the manager, who was effusively apologetic and offered us complimentary breakfast. However, the whole episode left a sour taste in our mouths. -newline-  -newline- Upon arriving home, we realised that we had left our baby monitor in the room. We have rung the hotel twice so far leaving messages with the lost and found department. We are still waiting for a response, 2 days later. No, I would not recommend staying at this hotel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Loews Hollywood Hotel		2011-10-03	4	This hotel is right in the heart of Hollywood. Easy to get to Burbank, Beverly Hills, etc. Some type of entertainment going on all the time by the locals. You couldn't ask for a better location. This was our 2nd time to stay there. Little disappointed in room decorating than the last time. Before all the rooms were so colorful , now it has tan walls and looks like a typical hotel room. Staff is wonderful. Room was kept very clean. If ever back around LA, this is the place we would stay at again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Loews Hollywood Hotel		2011-10-03	3	The hotel location is great for tourists, central to a large number of sites like the Kodak Theater and such and it is clean and well maintained with a beautiful pool area and great views of the Hollywood sign and Los Angeles downtown. That being said, they nickel and dime you in a ridiculous way. There is a $13 charge for wifi connection and a $5 charge to print at the business center. The Holiday Inn Express a half block away has both of these for free, charges half the price and has free parking. At a luxury hotel, charge me for the room, don't add extra dollars for services that should be a given in 2011!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

The hotel is well appointed and the staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful in assisting with planning day trips. The room was comfortable and the bed heavenly! Our only complaint was with one aspect of housekeeping. We were there for 5 days. The bathroom, while restocked each day with fresh towels,etc. was not vacuumed and tub not cleaned even after we brought this to the attention of Management.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Loews Hollywood Hotel		2011-05-23	4	This is a nice hotel, pretty much average rooms but well kept. It has a younger group of people as guests, 20's to early 40's I would say. The lobby can be a bit noisy during daytime hours but not too bad. The room service fast and the food quite good with a small free desert. The only problem I had, the maid service was slow. Came back after four hours out and the room still not done. I did call housekeepng and they did send a maid after 45 minutes. The location is right off Hollywood Blvd. The street is full of tourists and always busy . Just like the Vegas strip. I did not find any nice restaurants in the area. Hollywood still has that honkey tonk atmosphere.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

He is now fifteen and we finally made the trip staying at the Renaissance Hollywood hotel and spa. It was clean, smoke free and located right next to the Kodak and Chinese Theater. It's all about location,location,location! The down side was: 1) After spending 250.00 a night, we still had to pay for parking 2)In order to get a bottle of water for bed-time you had to walk out on the main strip or pay 6.25per bottle to get it from the hotel 3)In order for us to use my lap-top in the room I had to pay 12.95 a day.

There was the plaza right behind our hotel and it was nice to have somewhere to go in the mornings, before anything else was open. The bus and train station were right downstairs which was nice. The hotel was so clean, and the staff was very friendly and professional.

Loews Hollywood Hotel		2010-01-06	4	Had a great time. Nice room, great location, comfy bed. It's located right in the middle of all the sight seeing activities that you would need on a Hollywood vacation! The metro is convenient as transportation to Universal Studios $1.25 each way. Can't beat that. I was surprised that the hotel charged a $1.35 for each local call that is >5 miles away.I sure didn't see anything posted informing me of that one. I would of used my cell phone for free if I knew that. We also had charges from our mini bar that we did not use. (They removed those charges without asking twice) Nice hotel.

We walked to see the movie at El Capitan Theater, had dinner in the Disney Soda Fountain room, and walked around looking at all the stars on the sidewalks. Parents should be prepared that this isn't the most wholesome neighborhood - women in scanty costumes, lots of stores selling black leather biker and SM garb, sexy lingerie, bongs, etc. But it's a kick for an afternoon, with the Wax Museum and Ripley's Museum also within walking distance.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Because I've been to L.A. previously, I knew the location was going to be just what I needed, I just didn't know if the hotel would meet my expectations.  The hotel was great, I loved the decor of the lobby and the rooms and I loved the down comforters and pillows. I can honestly say I was very comfortable and felt like I was at home. I looked forward to going back to the hotel to rest and relax after being out all day.  I was also extremely pleased to find Aveda products in the bath room, especially the moisturizer!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

Loews Hollywood Hotel		2009-04-22	4	It is our second stay at this hotel. We came back because it's a great location. Tourist attractions such as the Chinese Grauman Theatre are around the corner. An outdoor mall links directly to the hotel, with tons of stores and restaurants. Great view of the Hollywood sign. Valet parking expensive at $29.00 a day but you can park your car yourself next door for $10.00 (you have to pay every time you take it out though but even if you do it twice a day it is still cheaper than valet). Convenient donut shop right across the street where we got croissants and coffee every morning to save on breakfast. Very close to the freeway. The traffic on Highland is nonstop but we never heard it from our room. We were 4 people in a room with 2 double beds. Good space, but we could use more drawers in the room. Had to call twice before housekeeping brought more hangers. Had trouble with the toilet, but they came right away and fixed it. The room had a lot more wear and tear than the room we stayed at last year (same hotel) but we found an unbeatable price through Orbitz so it was definitely worth it. Would recommend this hotel but will try something else next time.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Loews Hollywood Hotel		2008-09-06	5	The hotel was redone so it doesnt feel like an old crummy hotel, but they do nickel and dime you for everything.  They charged me twice for my one day internet, told me they would take it off, but then I had to ask the next day.  Overall, my stay was good, but I was there for a convention and not actually for hollywood.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Loews Hollywood Hotel		2008-06-15	5	We stayed recently with our two daughters (age 3 & 7) in order to attend a wedding. We got a larger room which was worth the extra money. The room was clean, comfortable and had a spectacular view of the Hollywood Hills. The only drawback was a somewhat uncomfortable pull-out sofa. Fine for kids but less than ideal for adult sleepers.      The clean and well-run swimming pool was a great family ammenity with great views. We spent hours there and it was never too crowded though my girls got a chance to meet other young hotel guests.      Another excellent feature for families is the adjoining shopping mall with good, affordable, family-friendly dining options, a reasonable amount of room to run-around, and shops for last-minute purchases. The mall was especially welcome since the in-hotel dining, while nice, was quite pricey (no more than most hotels, but it adds up when four are dining).       The staff was very nice -- from the gift shop, to check-in, to maid-service, to pool-side service.       Highly recommended!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>
Loews Hollywood Hotel		2008-02-03	4	The public areas of this hotel are very nice - the lobby is pretty spectacular and we attended a group dinner in the H&H Ballroom.  But it was a pretty standard room, for a high price.  The girl at check in didn't know if the hotel had cribs (please, it's a full-service hotel and they were probably 2/3 empty).  The toilet didn't have enough water pressure to flush efficiently, and the housekeeping staff asked my babysitter if we would want to change rooms (at 8 PM, when we were at dinner, and we had all the baby stuff set up all over...)  There really weren't enough towels - no extras.  The furniture was an attempt to be art deco but was not that comfortable and kind of rickety.  The bed/mattress was comfortable but the fixture squeaked when you got in and out of bed.  The view was nice - Hollywood sign and all.  But, if it weren't for our attendance at the event, because of work, we wouldn't have stayed there.  And, we won't tell any of our friends to stay there unless they want a high price for a very average hotel room.  We've stayed at other Renaissance properties, and this was was definitely not luxe, just plain.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1755 North Highland Ave, 1755 North Highland Ave, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Hollywood</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90028</span>

What a great location - walking distance to coffee shops, cafes and restaurants (both chain and local), shopping and night life in old town Pasadena. The hotel staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and accomodating. We were originally placed into a handicap room (which neither of us are) and the staff were understanding and accomodating to move us into another room wihtout any issue, and even moved our bags for us while we were out for the day. We stopped into the restaurant for a beer and spoke with who we assumed to be the restaurant manager, and had a really nice chat with him about Los Angeles and the surrounding area. There are comfortable chairs in the lobby area to relax in if you need to kill some time. Room was clean, bed was comfortable, sheets were soft and bathroom toiletries were wonderful.

Hilton Pasadena		2014-04-03	5	my parents visited pasadena for a week, and i booked marriot for first 5 days and hilton for the last 2 days ( i simply booked the cheaper one for each period). and apparently my parents liked hilton better, mostly because of better room conditions.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2014-01-26	4	So it was the Hilton and along with that, comes the prestige of the name. It was very clean and a great location for where I needed to be. Maybe this is the norm but there were certain things I would expect to be included in the cost of the room like wifi($9.95 / day) and parking ($18 / day). -newline-  -newline- If I had known this was the case, I would have stayed somewhere else. Everything else was great and the staff was very helpful to find me a place to get some late dinner at 1:00 AM. They even looked up the number and called the IHOP for me. -newline-  -newline- Room was great and very comfortable.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2014-01-03	4	We stayed for the Rose Bowl. Location is great. Complimentary shuttle which will pick you up or drop off for local things is really nice! Staff was friendly.

Hilton Pasadena		2013-05-10	2	Very expensive - I have never paid $200 for a three star hotel and that did not include internet ($10) and parking ($18). The worst thing though was that I purchased a room with a king bed but they gave me a room with two double beds. When I brought this to their attention they said they were under no obligation to honor this request from your company. I was celebrating my anniversary with my wife and they showed no desire to help me out	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2013-03-18	4	Due to my job i get a high level of stress. The way the rooms are set from the amazing views to the super soft beds, helped me relax and enjoy my sleep. The hotel as well as the staff were great.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2013-03-06	5	We were very satisfied with our stay. Price was not expensive.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2013-03-04	4	It was clean and organized. Parking cost $18.00 a day.

Hilton Pasadena		2012-03-13	4	The hotel worked perfectly. We just needed a clean place to stay that accepts dogs and is well located. $75 is a little steep for pet fee, but the place was nice and room service was better than most in this price range.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2012-03-12	4	bad news -- no hair-dryer; rough check-in; limited and boring beers on tap; and the parking at $18 a day is not convenient. -newline-  -newline- Good news -- v. quiet room; excellent bed; starbucks in hotel   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2012-03-03	4	I spent the business week at the Hilton--second or third visit. Staff are outstanding in helping with accommodations. This is a quiet hotel and easy to work on site. WI-FI available in a nicely appointed lobby and bar area. WI-FI in rooms at cost if you aren't an Honors member. Conveniently located near the Convention Center and within walking distance of Old Pasedena. Plenty of dining and shopping choices within walking distance. On site breakfast and lunch dining. On site pool and exercise room. Easy transportation via shuttle from and to LAX for those who don't want or need a car during the stay. Good value in my opinion.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2012-02-20	5	We enjoyed our time at the Hilton. It was convenient to the race expo and 2.5 miles from the start line. The hotel was clean and quiet, and the staff, friendly. Would stay again!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2012-02-20	5	My husband and I traveled to Pasadena for the Rock n Roll Half Marathon. The hotel was within walking distance of the expo (one block). It was approximately 2.5 miles from the start line, an easy and quick drive making the location perfect. There is a mall with lots of shopping and restaurants with in a few blocks. The hotel was clean and comfortable. The staff very friendly and helpful. The pool was heated and we enjoyed the jacuzzi pre-race. The only minus we experienced was that the walls were thin and we could hear the conversation in the next room, but it was not bothersome.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2012-01-18	3	The room the was small and the bed was small too.

Hilton Pasadena		2011-10-17	4	Helpful and courteous staff,hotel room was very clean and attention to detail was amazing would recommend to others.Hotel rates were also fairly good for the short time we stayed   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2011-10-17	3	No restaurant to have a small sit down meal. Although you are able to sit in the bar and order appetizers and sandwiches with your drink which is not bad. -newline-  -newline- The bar staff was great. Quick to respond and polite. -newline-  -newline- All other staff members were polite as well.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2011-09-14	3	Spent six nights at the Hilton Pasadena. Rooms are comfortable but dated faux-edwardian and clash with the equally dated "dot com era" lobby. Paint was peeling in big chips, dangling over my head from the bathroom ceiling. I could tell every color the room had ever been. -newline-  -newline- Bathroom is miniscule with door clearance about two inches from toilet. Air conditioner was LOUD. Bed was comfortable with good linens. Bar ambience is a little airport-y but a decent value with good service. -newline-  -newline- Staff was the high point, friendly and helpful (including room service guy who made sure to point out tip was included in bill, something you never see, and a housekeeper who jogged down the hall to see if I was ready to have my room cleaned, and server in bar who fed me about twenty pounds of snack mix) but parking staff was a little off (outside vendor, though, I think). -newline-  -newline- Hilton Pasadena will nickle-and-dime you for parking ($25 per day in PASADENA?) and so-called high-speed wireless ($10 per day), pretty pathetic for a "business hotel." Room service rates fairly reasonable, food there and in the bar pretty decent. Didn't try restaurant proper. Paid $139 per night for king room ($175 with parking and internet), before tax etc. -newline-  -newline- Overall not bad but will stay somewhere else next time I am in the City of Roses.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2011-09-07	5	My stay at the Hilton was fantastic to say the least! I specially loved the they provide coffee and tea.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2011-07-30	5	The hotel lobby, hallways, room etc. were very clean and very well decorated. the personnel were knowledgeable and friendly. Automobile parking was easily accessible. And the view from my room was very nice.  All in all my stay at the Hilton Pasadena was most pleasant.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2011-06-01	3	We booked this hotel as a cheaper alternative to attend a wedding reception held at the Westin. The hotels are somewhat deceptively far apart, which was unfortunate because it required a car which for us was $15 per 24 hour period just to park. -newline-  -newline- They charged $10 for Wifi which was decently fast. But there was no microwave, nor fridge in our room (maybe it was locked behind a cabinet we couldn't open?). The TV had several HD channels, which was really the only positive. Everything else was very average and ho-hum, and I felt ripped off by all the nickel and dime-ng I went through when I could've gotten those amenities for free at a cheaper MOTEL. -newline-  -newline- Oh, one last positive I just remembered: 20 oz sodas were only $1.50 from the vending machine. Yay. -newline-  -newline- I won't be coming back to this Hilton anytime soon. For the price it doesn't really do anything to outshine the experience I'd have gotten at a motel.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2011-02-24	4	Got upgraded to a suite,SWEET. Enjoyed the pool and hot tub. Very pleasant and efficient staff, we were always greeted with a smile. Only negative was the cost of parking.

Hilton Pasadena		2011-02-23	1	I WILL NEVER, EVER STAY AT THIS HOTEL AGAIN (OR ANY OTHER HILTON HOTELS). THEY CHARGED ME FOR FOUR MOVIES I DID NOT WATCH AND USE OF NINTENDO IN THE ROOM, WHICH I HAVE NEVER PLAYED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. WHEN I COMPLAINED THAT I WAS BEING CHARGED FOR SERVICES I DID NOT ORDER, THE FRONT OFFICE STAFF CALLED ME A LIAR AND WAS HOSTILE TO ME. I COMPLAINED TO MANAGEMENT AND DID NOT RECEIVE A STISFACTORY ANSWER. I AM A FREQUNET BUSINESS TRAVELER AND HAVE NEVER RECEIVED SUCH TREATMENT, NOR WILL I EVER SUBJECT MYSELF TO STAYING AT THIS HOUSE OF HORRORS EVER AGAIN. I'D RATHER STAY AT A MOTEL SIX THAN THIS PLACE	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2011-01-17	4	This hotel is not as modern as some of the other Hiltons I've stayed in, and that was evident in the bathroom with a hot water supply in the shower that varied between moderately and very hot without moving the controls! Occasionally, the walls felt a little thin too as sounds from rooms next door drifted into mine. -newline- However, the staff were very friendly and helpful, the pool was lovely,  and the in-room dining was delicious and attentively served.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2011-01-04	5	The hotel was beautiful, all the employees were very friendly and most helpful.  The hotel shuttle was a great amenity, it would take you anywhere within 2 miles.  The buffet breakfast was out of this world.  This was the best trip we have taken so far and we've been traveling regularly for the past 18 years.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2010-11-19	3	The bed and pillows were very comfortable, the towels nice and plush, and the shower was good.  However, the sink did not drain very well and the low-flow toilet did not exactly flush.  If one was not careful it would have been easy to make it overflow.  The passive ventilation for the bathroom did not work well, and the windows did not open, so a smell would sometimes pervade the room.  The entire hotel did not "feel" like a Hilton. -newline- My wife accidentally left a sweater in the dresser drawer.  She remembered about 10 PM on the check-out day and we immediately phoned the hotel.  They called back the next morning and said they could not find it.  I did not have any one's so I left the maid $5.  Apparently that person took the $5 and the sweater also.  Excellent location but I may look around a little more the next time we go to Pasadena.  The Cordon Bleau Culinary School is three blocks away.  They serve a three-course lunch (filet mignon, organic salmon and many more choices) for TEN DOLLARS!  Reservations are needed!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2010-11-16	4	Overall our stay at this Hilton was a pleasant one. We checked in rather late in the evening but the valet and front desk clerk were all very attentive and friendly. The rooms are nicely furnished with a ginormous hd flat panel in the room. Everything was tidy, however there were signs of some water damage in the ceiling area of the bathtub that got repaired in somewhat of a shoddy manner. Other than that everything was good. Quick easy drive to the Rose Bowl.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>

Good deal!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2010-10-18	3	Money has been put into fancying up the lobby, the ground floor restaurant, and the elevator areas. Don't expect to see any updated bathroom or room. The tile is from the 1980s and the ceiling is still the old acoustical popcorn type material. It's not what one expects from a Hilton.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2010-10-03	2	Nice-looking exterior, but that's about it. Parking at the hotel is $15, the room cost a total of $150, and truth be told, it was worse than some Motel 6's I've stayed at. The toilet was clogged from the time I arrived, and when I left it wouldn't flush. The atmosphere and decor did not reflect the price. My advice: if you're gonna stay in Pasadena, get a motel for half the price of this place. It is certainly NOT worth the money.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2010-07-25	3	We have stayed here many times.  While the public areas seem fresh, the rooms are in need of a face lift.  The lack of free internet is a nuisance.  If it weren't for the location and ability to earn Hilton HHonors points, we'd probably stay elsewhere next time.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2010-07-15	4	I stayed one night for a conference and had a chance to walk around the area around the hotel. There are a lot of nice restaurants and shops nearby, the surrounding area was clean and safe, even at night.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>

Hilton Pasadena		2010-06-27	4	Great experience! The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The location is superb! Tons of things to do to keep you busy. I stayed for IMATS at the convention center. The only thing I didn't like, were the paper thin walls. I could hear my neighbors coughing at night, peeing and closing drawers. Make sure you get a rate with the free breakfast. The rate for two people is $38!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>

Hilton Pasadena		2010-05-18	4	The Hilton Pasadena was a nice property...I slept well and the staff was nice/accomodating. The parking garage was under construction, but they did give us valet parking at the same rate that we'd have paid in the self parking garage. Overall, this was a nice place to stay for a night. Eat breakfast (or grab a pastry) at the Heirloom Cafe & Bakery while you're in Pasadena...it was AMAZING!!!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2010-05-18	5	Very good trip, the hotel is centrally located in Pasadena.  Easy access to anything you could possibly need.

Hilton Pasadena		2010-01-04	2	It took about 40 minutes to find our reservation from [...].  The electrical fire in the hotel happened when we were in our room and the fire dept. was called BUT an alarm was not sounded and we not notified, most likely the law was broken here.  We were just stuck in our room without use of elevator.Business office expenses were too high.  Room was ok but shower head was broken and the hook on the bathroom door was falling off. Pricey parking fee was charged.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2009-08-15	3	A nice, well-run hotel walking distance from the Paseo Colorado Mall in the heart of Pasadena.  The staff is very friendly, they have a first rate bar in the lobby, and a Starbucks, too.  I stayed in what they billed as the Deluxe King Bedroom, which turned out to be quite small, with an even smaller bathroom that I could barely move around in.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2009-08-03	3	Nice hotel however parking was not very accessable and cost extra ($15.00 per day), for the cost i expected free internet however that is an extra $9.95 per day.  so if you plan on driving in  and using internet add $25.00 per day...   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2009-08-02	3	Stayed at this hotel as it was the venue for a trade show - very convenient. Room nice on the surface, but maid service was lacking. Didn't clean/replace dirty glasses, ammenities and left long dark hairs in the bathroom. Lighting bad, especially if you want to read in bed. Bed was very comfortable and the shower had great water pressure. Could hear the people in the ajoining rooms and in the hallways. No restaurant, just a lobby bar. Not a great layout for the trade show, but it worked okay. If show gets much bigger - will have to move.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2009-06-25	4	The staff was very pleasant, intelligent and helpfull with directions and attraction suggestions that were appropriate and useful.

Hilton Pasadena		2008-08-04	4	Comfortable; staff helpful enough. Noise of air conditioning was problematic (enough to wake you in the night) but dining options are nice and the location is wonderful (within walking distance of shopping, dining, Old Town, entertainment).   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2008-08-03	4	Nicely located hotel, vibrant "downtown" area is very close.  The hotel is somewhat old though, biggest pet peeve is no fan in the bathroom!   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2008-06-14	2	The room was somewhat small, but this may be a constraint from refurbishing an older building.  However, it did not come with a small refrigerator, which was a real surprise, there is no vent fan in the bathroom (so the bathroom steams up quickly), and weirdly, the storage rack for the bath towels is inside the enclosure for the shower over the tub.  The room was close to the elevators, and when I was hoping for total quiet at night, there was an intermittent low mechanical rolling sound in the walls, which must have been from the movement of the elevator counterweights.  When we left in the morning, we rang the bell captain for help with the bags.  After 10 minutes or more, he finally showed up.  I told him we had been about to leave without him.  He seemed apologetic, but then launched into a series of small romantic songs as we went down the hall and got in the elevator.  I finally asked him what would it take to get him to stop singing, and he finally got the point.      A very strange stay.  I don't care to repeat the experience.  Over-priced too, considering the amenities.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">168 South Los Robles Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Pasadena</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91101</span>
Hilton Pasadena		2007-09-04	5	Nice hotel with comfortable beds.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-05-25	3	Booked this room last minute. It was near Universal Studios which is why we chose it. The location was great. The room was clean and the staff friendly.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-04-09	4	The overall experience was amazing. We stayed at this hotel for a week and the rooms were always cleaned when we arrived back at the hotel after long days of viewing the city. The pool was great and we were in there at least once a night. However I did notice they could have cleaned the pool more often. Probably was cleaned every 2-3 days by the looked of it. There were just flower and plants in the pool. Hotel is right beside a Denny's which I found convenient and the food and service there is fantastic. The only experience I had that I was unsatisfied was when a high school group came to stay at the hotel and they weren't well behaved. We had a group of kids yelling and screaming right in front of our door. We had to ask them to be quiet and they still didn't listen. They were also running all over the place at 7am and when they were in the pool they were just as loud and inconsiderate of those around them. Nonetheless they were only there for a night or two and I was still able to enjoy my trip. I would book here again despite all that	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-04-07	3	Romm and staff were Very Good, but parking is the worst. 3 times coming back after midnight, I've had to park off site: once around 1/4 mile away. -newline-  -newline- Tired to get the hotel to have 1 assigned parking spot per room, but was always ignored. -newline-  -newline- Stay here, unless you got out at night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-03-26	3	I have stayed in the King suites previously, so this review is only regarding the two-bed tower suites: -newline-  -newline- Noise level is slightly higher on the 3rd floor of the tower, parking near the tower rooms is not usually enough if all the rooms are booked, you'll find yourself parked across the property or on the street if you come back to your room late enough. The elevators are a little scary. One of them's door doesn't close all the way immediately (it will eventually when the elevator starts moving) but they are relatively fast at least. -newline-  -newline- Rooms are much the same as the King bed rooms in the main courtyard, they seem slightly smaller, but that may just be because there are two beds in the room instead of one. Bathroom is adequate, but not luxurious. -newline-  -newline- Best feature is that you are close to the Jacuzzi. -newline-  -newline- I will likely stay here again, but I'll probably not stay in the tower again unless something goes wrong with my booking.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-03-15	3	The big negative to our time here was the remodel, and I can't really blame anyone for that. A hotel has a right to remodel! So it's too bad that our window overlooked the dumpster. There was only noise during one day, and never at night. We had to use different stairs. Neighborhood borderlines scary when you go north or east, but I did feel the hotel was a nice one, and convenient to be close to 405 and the galleria. The pool was nice and staff was friendly and helpful. Just be sure to check if they're done with the remodel if that kind of thing would bother you. Otherwise, I do recommend this location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-03-14	2	WE WERE ONLY IN L.A. FOR A FEW DAYS TO VISIT AN AILING RELATIVE. AT FIRST GLANCE THE BEST WESTERN CARRIAGE INN WAS VERY ATTRACTIVE AND THE ROOM WAS VERY CLEAN. -newline- PROBLEM WAS.....THE SECOND DAY THE HOT WATER WAS ALMOST NON EXISTENT..I SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING BUT WE WERE IN A HURRY...THE THIRD DAY (WE WERE CATCHING AN 8:00 A.M PLANE)..THERE WAS NO HOT WATER AT ALL..THE NIGHT BEFORE MY HUSBAND WENT TO GET SOME BOTTLE WATER AND THERE WAS NONE...NOT IN THE MACHINE..NOT ANYWHERE.. -newline- ASIDE FROM THAT..THE LOCATION FOR US WAS PRETTY GOOD.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-03-13	4	The hotel is clean & neat looking - the room had 2 queen sized beds that were very comfortable. The pool is not extra large but we enjoyed it, For us the area was perfect - near relatives and friends that we wanted to see & not too far from LA, Hollywood, & the airport. The staff in the office were very helpful and pleasant. We definitely would stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-03-03	4	Third floor of one bldg had one part leaking. The first room they gave us was leaking was well. They gave us a new room immediately which is good. Room was clean, there was a divider between the beds and the wash are before the bathroom, which gave a little privacy when with company. Location is okay, area seemed safe and a few minutes away from downtown LA and Hollywood. However there wasnt much in the neighborhood, only a Denny's by the hotel. No comp breakfast, which makes it a little expensive. They let us checkin earlier than 3pm which is the best thing.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-02-28	4	The location was perfect for our visit. Denny's was next door which made breakfast very convenient. Staff was very friendly.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-02-20	4	We had a great week. We were visiting relatives, and the hotel was less than 2 miles from them. The hotel was very clean, the pool area was nice too. The only problem we had was the construction that was going on during the week. It was hard to find a parking spot close to our room because of all the construction vehicles. All in all, it was a very nice vacation.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-02-16	5	Everything great here, we stayed 3 days. I was worried about the proximity to the freeway being a problem but it wasn't.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-01-29	4	I was completely satisfied with my room. The location was very convenient. A Denny's diner associated with the motel was very helpful for me since it's open 24-hours a day and had a broad menu. I had irregular meal hours and was able to get good meals there. The downside was the motel did not have a complimentary breakfast. But Denny's gave a 10% discount to motel guests and a 15% discount for AARP members.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-01-27	3	On arrival the hotel looked average but the staff made it a little better than that. The room had a few issues but nothing to be upset about...just needs some updating and a little special attention in certain areas. The only REAL PROBLEM that we had is that the days we allowing our room to be cleaned were the days that our keys didn't work when we returned in the early morning tired and wanting to go straight o bed! There is no way to call the front desk unless you use your personal phone and then they tell you to come get the key at the front desk which was clear across the property for us and after walking a country mile for lack of finding parking....REALLY! Needless to say, we went without housekeeping services for 2 of the nights that we were there.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-01-23	3	I liked the location, it was close to most major attractions, with very easy access to the highways. The staff was very nice. They were having some construction on sections of the hotel, but that did not interfere with our comfort. I would stay here again and recommend this place to others.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-01-18	3	We were pleased with our room and the location of this hotel. The pricing was very good considering we we in LA. We did run into one problem and that was we had no air conditioning due to some construction taking place that somehow disturbed it just before we arrived. However it was a pleasant day and we were not uncomfortable. And they offered us compensation by way of room price reduction. So all in all a good experience.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-01-08	3	I have always stayed on the second floor of the main area. I have never stayed in the tower rooms. There is some road noise, being placed in between a freeway, and two major thoroughfares, but it's not something I really notice much. I did hear a lot of fire engines last time I was there though, so there might be a fire station nearby that will interrupt your peace. -newline-  -newline- The rooms have always been very clean, though occasionally you'll see something like the towel bars are a bit loose on the walls. -newline-  -newline- Never noticed any bad odors, no weird stains on the sheets or carpet. That's pretty much the extent of my pickiness. -newline-  -newline- Sometimes the hot water in the shower takes a while to get hot. But it does get there. And I have yet to stay in a room where the exhaust fan in the bathroom looks like it's actually working, that being said, I've never seen any traces of mold or mildew in the bathrooms. -newline-  -newline- The Denny's in the parking lot offers a discount with your room key, so that's nice. And the parking lot itself, while having somewhat tight spaces, I've only not been able to find parking in front of my room once in about four stays.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2014-01-06	5	I had a pleasant stay there for 2 days. The room is clean and comfortable, with its own heater. I read the previous reviews that parking could be a problem, but I did not experience any difficulty. The staff are very nice and helpful, and when I asked about whether they have discounted tickets to Universal Studios, they replied to me that their system has been down but they generally do sell these tickets. They directed us to a nearest Costco, and we got our year pass for 75 dollars each. -newline-  -newline- The location is GREAT. It is right off highway and the local traffic was pretty smooth. (compared to the huge traffic load close to downtown) It is a good compromise between the hollywood attractions/theme parks and the beautiful beaches (santa monica, venice, mahatten), all within 20 mins driving.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-11-20	3	This hotel is in a good location and has a cheap rate. While the room was somewhat clean, it often smelled of smoke and there were ants in some areas. I also found a cracker and sucker in the desk drawer that hadn't been clean. The pool/spa area was just OK and the gym was minimal. It's great that Denny's is in the parking lot. -newline-  -newline- All of that said, it wasn't a horrible experience. It's a great location if you need to stay in the Los Angeles/Burbank/North Hollywood area. It's right off several highways. There's a Target down the road, along with some fast food restaurants. South of the hotel, there is also a mall with some eateries, which I didn't notice until our last day. -newline-  -newline- The staff was accommodating. -newline-  -newline- If you are looking for a cheap place to just lay your head at night, this is it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

Spotless and the room was good sized. Really comfortable. The room didn't have a microwave like the Burbank Best Western does, which is a nice convenience, but overall the room was bigger and cleaner. -newline-  -newline- It is literally right off the 405 freeway. That could be a good or a bad thing. The good is that freeway access is super easy. The bad is the 405 is a parking lot most of the time.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

The bed was comfy and the sheets were clean. I felt comfortable sleeping there. The towels were kind of old and did not have that smell that the towels in top hotels do but they were clean. But the price was absolutely right. FREE WIFI!!! We'll be sating there again next week. The attached Denny's is a bonus for breakfast and the money you save more than makes up for the lack of continental breakfast when you consider you can get a real breakfast there.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-10-23	4	Very impressed with the cleanliness and updated look; pleasant staff. A little noise, but not a big issue. I left two items in the room when I departed and they were there when I called back to retrieve them. My issue is that there had apparently been a fire earlier that day (could smell it when I walked around). They did not mention anything about it when I checked in, but when I got into my room there was no A/C, no TV channels, no internet and no hot water. I called the front desk and they said "they are working on all of those since the fire, and they should all be fixed SOON". The hot water was fixed by the time I showered in the morning, everything else was still not working. I believe they should have told me about all the issues and allowed me the option of a refund and going to another hotel, or discount to stay there.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-10-19	3	Average hotel. I did not pay much, so I can't complain much either, but there was lots of street noise. The AC unit continuosly cycles on and off and can't be set to a fan only white noise setting to cover it up. Loud banging each evening that sounded like air in the pipes when water was running. I could not find the source of that noise. Annoying at midnight. The maids tap on the door (well before noon) to see if you need service even if the do not disturb sign is out. No breakfast provided, although Denny's next door gives a 10% discount. Affordable but not very restful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

Rooms are always clean, staff is always helpful. Free Wi-Fi in the rooms. AC works. Safe. Free Parking. -newline-  -newline- Discount at the Denny's in the parking lot, though I've never used it. They also have a pool I've never used. But it looks decent. -newline-  -newline- Can hear some road noise from if you are in the end rooms.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-09-23	4	Their staff was very helpful. -newline-  -newline- When we first checked in there was an air conditioner problem.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-09-23	4	We were hoping this would be closer to Burbank (it was about a 20 minute drive without traffic) but we enjoyed this hotel very much for our one night stay. The room was clean and the linens on the bed were great! Only wished we could've slept in! We had an early morning appointment in Burbank and wished the hotel offered a quick breakfast like many do (they claimed it was because of the Denny's next door, but we didn't have time for a sit down breakfast). There's a coffee maker and fridge in the room so you can plan ahead and bring a few things. We enjoyed the pool too. We stayed here because they were offering a promotional discount and overall happy with our brief stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-09-19	3	We enjoyed our stay over there, the rooms were tidy and clean, the 2 guys at the frontdesk were so helpful particularly Mr.Wahid. -newline- It may need a little rennovatin including the doors of the bathrooms, and if there is any solution to the noise of the cars that would've been great.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-09-15	3	We chose this hotel for our four-night stay because it was deeply discounted that week. The room was ok, but it's definitely not a "Best Western Plus" level (we had stayed at many BW hotels during our coast-to-coast drive earlier this year, so we can say that with confidence). In particular, not only there's no breakfast at this location: they've partnered with what seems, judging from Yelp reviews, to be one of the worst Denny's in the country.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-08-31	2	Upon check-in, the guy could not find my reservation, so I stood there until he could figure it out. I was immediately given an upgrade for the wait. I appreciated that. The room was nice and clean. I didn't have a "do not disturb" sign in my room, so at 8:30 every morning, I was woken up by the housekeeping staff. This was not pleasant as I am not a morning person. When booking the room, I was supposed to have complimentary breakfast. I called the front desk and the guy was rude and said I would have to speak to the manager. I walked to the front desk and the front desk manager wasn't there. Okay? I showed him my reservation on my phone and he gave me my breakfast passes. -newline- The walls are super thin so don't be surprised when you can hear entire conversations, or better yet, screaming children in the room next to you, along with the noise above you if you're assigned a room on the first floor. -newline- The gentleman I dealt with at checkout was great...too bad I didn't interact with him sooner. -newline- My most satisfying part of the stay was going to Denny's (which is what the free breakfast is valid). The staff there was friendly and accommodating. Even though my breakfast was free, it didn't stop the staff from providing excellent service. So thank you Denny's for making the stay tolerable.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-08-28	4	The hotel was very good It was clean I liked the Dennys right in front saved time in the morning the only thing that disappointed me was the hotel has NO shuttle service to the airport and I spent alot of money on going to the hotel in Sherman oaks and going back to the LAX airport The hotel has a van but does not use it apparently for guests I would love that to change than I would absolutely stay there again	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

About 10 minutes away from Universal, 15 to 30 depends on traffic to Santa Monica Pier, 30 min to Griffin Observatory and Walk of Fame area, straight drive on the 405 to LAX took 45 min because of morning traffic. The only complaint I have is because the hotel doors are directly outside I can smell people smoking other than that decent location drivable to local stores would stay here again when visiting LA area	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-07-30	4	The staff was kind and the room was nice - very clean, comfy bed, good sized bathroom, and the housekeepers took great care of us! We had an interesting schedule, but they paid close attention and were still able to clean our room when we left. The pool and hot tub were nice, especially because the weather in this location is always warmer than the rest of Los Angeles. -newline-  -newline- Its' location is central to all of LA, so it was easy to get around. Having Denny's on site was great because it's open 24 hours, so we never had to worry about leaving the hotel for food. When we did want to get out for a meal, their are a TON of options very close by, everything from fast food to fine dining. -newline-  -newline- I would definitely stay here again - especially for the great deal and value we got at this hotel!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-07-17	4	When my cousin and I decided to take a roadtrip to California for the weekend, we had a pretty hard time finding where to stay. We wanted something that was within our budget but that didnt look like something out of a horror flick! We also needed it to have a perfect location for all the places we wanted to go. Thank God we found the Best Western Carriage Inn! This hotel has the PERFECT location!! Everywhere we wanted to go was 30 min away tops! Close to places like Hollywood bLvd, Santa Monica/Venice Beach, Universal City and Six Flags Magic Mountain! The rooms were VERY clean and comfortable! It had all the amenities we could ask for like a fridge, tv with HBO, coffee maker, iron, safe, extra pillow and blanket already there and best of all FREE WIFI! The staff at the front desk were very nice, helpful and attentive! Everything was pretty much perfect EXCEPT THE PARKING! They have such limited spaces here that any time we would get back to the hotel late, it would be completely full! It was pretty frustrating after getting back so tired and wanting to go to bed! We had to wait about 10 mins for someone to leave and another time we needed help from the staff to park! That's the only reason i didnt give it an overall of 5 stars! I recommend this hotel to anyone who is going to the LA/Hollywood area and I will definitely be staying here again!!!

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-07-03	4	Hotel is very conveniently located near the intersection of the 101 and 405 fwys and Ventura Blvd where there are loads of restaurants. Apart from the noise of the main roads/fwy and nearby fire station, it was a great bargain. Pool is nice, but it was heated ... and in near 100 degree temps, not very refreshing.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-06-28	2	The staff was not friendly. They offered a dark room (located under part of the building) at first and after complaining, they gave us another dark room. Only after insisting again, they offered a room with more light from outside. -newline- They fool you on their website as they show rooms from the tower suites and not the rooms that you finally get. -newline- The parking is cleaned during the day with a lot of noise that goes on and on..... -newline- Beside these negative experiences, everything else is average what you can expect for such a price but I would not stay again there.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

The bed was very comfortable, the pillows fluffy. We had 2 sinks, a fridge but if you want a microwave it's $5 extra per night. Coffee in the morning in the lobby and also in room. Pool & hot tub nice, there was a small workout room. It was locked but we didn't want to use it anyway. Crews were working hard keeping the property clean. At night there are white lights around the palm trees that looks so nice. Would stay here again especially using online pricing discounts.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-04-14	4	The hotel on the outside looked great, however, it was a pain to find parking. I think that they should make enough parking spots for the amount of tenants they have. If you get hungry, then i suggest not going to the Denny's that's connected to the hotel. The food was tasteless and not cooked all the way. However that was at about 2 in the morning so the morning cooks may be better. The hotel room itself is also very nice and the beds and pillows are extremely comfortable. Overall i had a lovely stay.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-03-28	4	My stay here was very pleasant except for a couple things. One of the two elevators for the Tower rooms was in serious need of maintenance. This was a relatively minor issue, and I reported it to the staff. The other, more serious issue, is parking. This hotel does NOT have enough parking to accommodate all of their clients on busy weekends. If you come in late, you will either be parking in the aisles or in the street, and most likely no where near to your room. -newline- The staff was very friendly and accommodating, handling an issue I had quickly and easily.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-03-25	1	Went to check in at 5:45pm and the room was NOT ready. Location is right on the freeway and it is very noisy. The hotel was painting and there was plastic sheeting on everything including the fake grass and all windows. There were stains in the sink. And the air conditioning system wasn't working. You are right on the freeway. I booked there because it was pet friendly. I just came from another hotel which was so clean and welcomed my pet with treats, blankets, and toys its pet fee. This hotel does charge a pet fee but you get nothing, not even a bowl and there is no place to take your pet to do its business. I would not recommend that you walk outside of the hotel at night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-01-31	4	This place was a little pricey but its the convenience factor. The Towers building has the nicest rooms and I recommend that as a request.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-01-22	3	It was a fine hotel. A little on the noisy side. I stopped by at 9am to leave my car and asked for a quiet room when I checked in later. I went back at about 6pm and when I got my room it wasn't that quiet. When I called down to the front desk I was told those rooms got taken first. I explained that I had stopped by at 9am to arrange for a quiet room. He asked the name of the person I spoke to which I gave him, but still there were no other rooms. It was clean enough and efficient.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>
BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2013-01-18	4	I've stayed twice for a few days each time at this Best Western, and it is an incredible bargain and perfectly placed for someone who wants a home base close to highways. Sherman Oaks has a number of great affordable neighborhood restaurants, too. -newline-  -newline- The rooms are nothing fancy, but they are well maintained, and each room I've been in has enough soundproofing that I can't hear noise from the (loud) street out front or adjoining rooms or the parking lot. -newline-  -newline- On my last business trip, I needed to go to Studio City, Culver City, Pasadena, and Hollywood, and those were only 10 to 30 minutes away from this hotel. -newline-  -newline- My only complaint is that the in-room heating/air-conditioning controls are either on or off. During a summer trip, it was easy to get frozen; on this cold January, the "low heat" seemed unconnected with the temperature dial and I was blasted hot.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2012-12-15	3	On a surface level the rooms are decent; nothing fantastic but adequate, especially for a short stay. A couple of things that lower my rating of room comfort: the shower was awful, felt like it was lightly sprinkling on me. I could not wash my hair because the water pressure was not sufficient enough to get the shampoo out! Also, my door had large gaps around it which made it very drafty at night. They could sure save some money if they invested in some decent weather stripping...probably enough to get better shower heads and then guests don't have to leave their heaters on all night.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2012-09-21	4	My complaints about the Carriage Inn are very minor. I was trying to book a place and having internet issues but finally got this one. A previous experience with a different chain had me expecting bad or at least mediocre, but Carriage Inn really surprised me. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the rooms were overall clean, in great shape, and comfortable. I did find a couple toenail clippings in a corner that were missed, and the TV was staticky on a few channels, but those are very minor complaints. The staff was super-courteous and friendly, and even the cleaning staff (I interrupted a maid three times with items I'd forgotten in my room, and she was very gracious about my interruptions). Everything was in great shape, I will gladly return and recommend to anyone in need of a hotel in the Sherman Oaks area.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2012-07-16	4	The place was good because there was a gas station across the street and a Denny's right in the area. The only downfall is that there was a discount for customers that stayed in the hotel, but I was not informed by the staff about the discount. The room was clean and the place was quiet. The free parking and roominess of the parking lot was great. The bed was comfortable besides the pillows. The couch looked old and dirty, did not want to relax on it. No free breakfast for the high price. The staff was nice and friendly.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2012-06-12	3	Overall experience was good. We were in town for a wedding and the location was central and fit our needs. The hotel itself had more of a motel feel to it as the rooms opened up to Sepulveda Blvd and the Denny's shared a parking lot. Opening the door of the hotel let in the waft of odors coming from the Dennys as well as the hustle and bustle of Sepulveda which is a very busy street. The rooms and the property were well kept and relatively clean. The bathrooms did not have working fan/vents and room service never left enough replacement towels. -newline- Other than that, everything was ok and if I had to, I would book again. No real amenities to speak of except for a 10% discount at the Denny's.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2012-05-29	1	We were very disappointed in these accomodations. We had no hot water in the shower or sinks for 2 days. After contacting the front desk, we were told they had completely sold out for the night. They also stated no other rooms were having this problem, but they would see what they could do. We wonder if they had overbooked, and gave us a room that was scheduled for repair, and this room should not have been occupied for the weekend (even though we made our reservations over a month in advance!) The staff promised to contact management. However, at this writing, no attempts have been made to contact us or compensate for our visit . Needless to say, we will never book with this hotel, or for that matter, Best Western, again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

That being said the hotel is just a place to bed down,the room was very clean your typical amenities, could of used better blanket on the bed though.Staff was friendly. The hotel is right near the 405/burbank exit so traffic can be tough @ times. You are close to just about everything the parking lot gets full as there is a Dennys in the lot and can be noisy @ times.Used the pool only once. It was a little smaller but nice and secluded.

If you want a place where the staff is just too helpful, this is the place. They don't waste time and money changing your bed if it doesn't need it. The cleaners were out and about from early morning 'til late at night. You can ask them for help anytime. ONLY one problem... I only found one that spoke any English. Since this is America I think that this should be recified even a little. There is a 24-hour restaurant on the site and as I kept weird hours, it was great (but I wish they would clean the restaurant really good , especially the carpet. This is the best place I have ever stayed in and everytime I visit the Los Angeles area, I will return.

They have a gym open 24 hours and a heated year round pool. If your not out of your room by 12 sharp they do get kind of pushy, even if you are shlepping your luggage down two floors.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2011-11-01	4	I'm pretty exacting when it comes to hotel cleanliness. I found this hotel to be IMMACULATE. The bed was very comfortable and exceptionally clean - no icky bedspread to deal with; instead, there's a white cover that I am assuming is changed for each guest. -newline-  -newline- The hotel isn't fancy, but they provide all you need. We rarely stay in our room as we generally travel to see the sights, so we don't see the need for spas, turn downs, exotic restaurants at our hotel. We need a clean bed and bath - just what we got.

After reading reviews for other hotels around Universal City, I was concerned.

You came evening late - no parking and you put your car somehere on empty place, blocking other cars. -newline- Second problem - cleaning. I was staying for a week and expect room to be as i'm first day at the hotel. -newline- But it's not like that.

When we checked in the only handicapped parking was in front of the office and our room was around the other side of another building and there were speed bumps and dips. We asked the staff for help and they told us we could park in a no parking spot closer to the room, but the speed bumps were there and the slope of the street made us almost flip the wheelchair and left me screaming and crying. The air conditioning in the room started off cold but I woke up sweating as it broke during the night. In the morning I called the office and they said they would send someone, but the time kept changing and I had my doctor's appt. by then. If you are ok then the room will be fine for you, but if you're handicapped or hurt I would look elsewhere.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">5525 Sepulveda Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Sherman Oaks</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91411</span>

In fact staff was rude and obnoxious when we complained that the room was not ready when we went to room after being told it was and the clerk at the front desk checked us in and gave us the key.

BEST WESTERN PLUS Carriage Inn		2011-08-07	3	I would give this hotel an average grade. We stayed in a room with 2 queen beds and room was small. The toilet was clogged the same day, when we asked for a maintenance it turned out that the housekeeping accidentally threw a soap in the toilet and it was clogged. Cleaning services did not change our towels daily, we had to ask them for clean towels, also no shampoo refills. TV was not working so we had to ask maintenance to fix it.

The London also had really good food...pricey a small burger is 21 dolllars and a glass of ok champs is 17 that was on the low side compared to the other champs. On to the negative! We thought the pool area was dirty and gross...it had out door grass carpet that was moldy and smelled. They had these large palm trees that blocked the sun and the chairs needed to be replaced ASAP!

What is included is just the breakfast bar.  All expresso drinks, egg dishes etc are all extra.  I would have liked this clarified on my reservation or check in. -newline- The room was well appointed, the bath was spectacular and the bed was comfortable.  The gym and pool area on the rooftop are very nice. -newline- Last time I visited family I stayed at the Mondrian.  It had in my opinion a more beautiful breakfast area near the gorgeous pool area.  However, the exercise room was just a room outfitted with equipment and the general -newline- feel of the hotel was more hip and noisy at night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1020 N.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2013-10-15	4	Hotel is close to the LAX airport and the 405 fwy making access to several locations a breeze. (short cut to beach - avoiding the fwy which is always jammed - is to travel west on Jefferson) Staff was always pleasant and they generously provided us with their warm cookies whenever asked. Had a minor issue with an electrical outlet that was remedied in minutes of my call and technician was also courteous. There were 4 in our group and we would definitely stay there again. I had believed breakfast was included with my reservation but it had not been (this may have been an over-site in the booking agent?).

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2013-07-30	3	Booked into a handicapped room. Not handicapped-amenable, you actually needed to be handicapped to use it. For instance, one needed to kneel in the shower to wet their hair. The excuse was that we booked through a third party and that's what you get. Finally, they changed the room and things got better.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2013-04-28	4	We stayed at this hotel the night before leaving LAX very early. It was a good enough hotel, comfy beds, clean and well presented. We liked the token cookie too. -newline- Perfect for a quick night stay before a flight. -newline- But beware: check if they have a shuttle to the airport as we had seen it advertised and then once there they said the service was no longer available.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2012-05-21	4	I thought the hotel was wonderful... the only issue I would mention is the 'Parking Fee' of $15.00 per day. I am not disputing the fact that they are charging a fee necessarily, however, I think it should either be included in the overall hotel cost and if not done that way, that all potential guests be made aware of this added cost before they finalize their reservation. The people were extremely friendly...the room was nice...had everything one could need, other than a personal chef in the closet haha. I would recommend it highly. :)	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2012-03-17	2	We arrived at this hotel later in the day and the staff was very friendly, at check in. The room was very clean at first, then realized the outlets look like they had been broke and dirty. Then we proceeded to the hot tub. The hot tub was about 80 degree's tops, so when another guest came out about 10 minutes of us being in the hot tub, we proceeded to explain that it was cold, she went and told staff and the front and they said they would be right out to turn in up. 10 more minutes passed and they still weren't out there, my sister went it and confronted them and they said sorry, he (pool man) is on another call. After about a total of 45 minutes I went inside and asked, the only thing she could say was "we are sorry, he is still on another call." I went back out to the hot tub and then 15 minutes later still no one. I went inside and said "forget it" and all they would do is tell me they were sorry. Not very accommodating to our needs and expectations. Its a hot tub, not a pool. You have to pay for parking and the parking lot only had bus parking left when we got there, maybe a bigger parking lot if there are that many guests. Couldn't even park in a stall.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2012-01-11	5	I have nothing but good things to say about DoubleTree by Hilton In Culver City, it was fantastic! We stayed there for 2 weeks over Christmas and New Years. Our room was very comfortable, and we had a beautiful view. The location was great, only minutes away from all of the tourist areas. The staff was very friendly, the food was amazing, and the outdoor pool was great, it felt like a hot bath.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2011-12-21	4	I was visiting friends in Santa Monica and for the extra 15 minutes of driving, the Doubletree cost half as much for a superior room.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2011-12-08	4	The Doubletree is a beautiful hotel and a great value. It has a perfect location and is conveniently located for business, shopping and tourism. -newline- The only negatives: -newline- 1. $15.00 per day parking charge -newline- 2. Excessive linen damage charge of $150.00 because we got some tanning goop on a bed sheet. The solution is washable so the sheet was not really damaged.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2011-11-07	3	This is actually a decent hotel. Quick check in and friendly staff. Generally a comfortable stay - but we were only there a night. I thought the hot water in the bathroom took longer than average to heat up and when it did, it wasn't particularly warm. The bathroom was also very small. Parking is $15 a night, which seems to be about average for the area. For the price we paid, I wish it would have included some type of free breakfast.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2011-10-11	4	This hotel is popular with flight crews and foreign tourists departing/arriving LAX. Location near I-405 freeway makes getting around easy; plenty of parking (@ $15/day); rooms were clean and very comfortable with room-darkening curtains to let you oversleep if you want. 37" LG flat screens in every room with sat. TV access. Good value for L.A. Wait staff at lounge and restaurant were green and less attentive than I prefer, but otherwise this was a good value -- I will stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2011-10-09	2	Well, the staff & breakfast were great, but that's where it ends. A staff member tried to help us find a satisfactory room, but all had a mildew sort of odor & malfunctioning/non-functioning sleep number beds. We felt bad for the staff member as it's obvious the property owner failed to place high enough priority on the rooms. We were shown between five and ten rooms and all were in need of renovation. My recommendation is to not book a room here if there are no photos of the rooms available for viewing and if the rooms in the photos do not appear to be newly renovated.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2011-09-17	4	I booked a trip to LA which included a stay at Doubletree by Hilton (West Centinela Ave, Culver City). Although I booked it month and a half in advance and everything was paid, when we arrived at the front desk they told us "we have news for you. The hotel is fully booked, so we decided to move you to another place". They moved us to Hilton Hotel at the LAX Airport, which was really good, but the location sucks. It`s simply too far away. Every morning you have to drive a car at least an hour to get where you want. I know it`s LA, and if you want to go somewhere that you need a car, but for that money we spent for that Hotel, my friend was staying in a hotel which is a 10-minute walk from Walk of Fame! At Hilton, they gave us free parking for the whole stay and high-speed internet free of charge, as compensation for moving from one place to another. All in all, great experience and I would recommend it to anyone going to LA. But a car is a must!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2011-09-13	5	We've stayed at numerous hotels of all types around the country and this was definitely one of the best values i've found. The hotel was clean, the rooms were clean, the staff was extremely helpful and friendly, they had a very nice (and also clean) pool with late hours, and the location was fantastic. Within 10 min of Marina Del Rey, 15 of Santa Monica/Venice, and 20 from Hollywood and Beverly Hills, there was no shortage of things to do or places to dine. You do have to pay for parking, but after asking, they had no problem giving us a discounted rate since we were staying more than one night. All around a very well managed hotel!

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2011-01-01	1	All windows in every room are sealed and can not be opened. Bathroom doesn't have any ventilation system and you will smell all your poop over night. They try to save some electricity costs by sealling all the windows. Air quility is horrible because you are breathing in several years old air trapped inside the building. -newline- The management is purely money oriented and don't care about customer health. Staffs were cold and not helpful. -newline- They also charge $15/day parking fee on top of the room charge.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2010-03-17	3	Upon entering our room (#534) I was pleasantly surprised. It was spacious, clean and with nice decor. The bathroom on the other hand was weird. For some reason we were put in a handicapped accessible room which had us dodging all manner of old rusting safety rails in the shower as well as a shower head that I had to rig to get it up to a height that a normal person would use. I could have lived with all this but later that night when we got back to our room we returned to find our room was flooded out from a leak in the unit above us. This meant we had to pack up all our stuff and move to another room (1033) just at a time that we were ready to enjoy some rest and relaxation after a long day. The staff was courteous enough about the whole episode and offered us a complimentary breakfast as well as parking, which was appreciated. The room we moved to had it's peculiarities too though. One of the bedside light was coming off the wall, another lamp in the room didn't work and the carpet was all gathered and bunched up giving the appearance of a somewhat dangerous situation. And to top it all off on the last night of my stay we lost power in one half of the unit (the side with the TV, fridge and desk light). It was the end of the day - I could live without all those items for another 12 hours in lieu of hosting a repair person in my room while I was packing up for my departure. All in all it was a lovely hotel fraught with many little complications and annoyances. Staff was pleasant.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2009-09-22	4	I had to move out of my house somewhat sudden. Afte that, I have been in probably 7 hotels in 3 weeks. This was the first place I stayed in the beginning. This is also the last one I am staying at. This has been by far the best hotel I have been to out of them all. The service is great, It allows pets, The room is a nice size and includes a nice desk, Resteraunt staff and room service staff are wonderful. I really have nothing bad that I can say about this place.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2009-09-21	3	The location was great! Your by everything from the movies, a mall around the corner, to Nordstrom Rack. The hotel lobby was beautiful, the staff was friendly. The Bar area was awesome there was some live Jazz during the weekend so the area was busy. I was not to found of the bathroom because it was small and the water pressure was very low. You had to flush the toilet twice ÔÅå I was also not pleased with the high cost of parking per day. Overall it was quiet and nice I would stay their again only if I got a good rate I wouldn't dare pay the hotel price per night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2009-09-06	2	This hotel is not in a great location if you want to be near anything of interest in LA.  It is close to the freeway, but that is a little annoying if you are trying to relax by the pool.  We booked this because of the great rate, but were disappointed that they charge an additional $14 a day to park there.  The staff was generally unenthusiastic and the internet access consisted of 2 kiosks in the lobby with super slow connections (although I think they also offered wireless access if you have your own laptop).  One night we decided to relax in our room and called to request a corkscrew from the front desk.  They told us we needed to bring our bottle of wine down to the bar and the bartender would open it.  They did, but this was really inconvenient.  One morning we went down to the pool (around 10 am) and there were no clean towels, just a pile of dirty ones.  The windows do not open so there is no fresh air at all, and the room was only moderately clean (at best) . -newline- The pool, whirlpool, and fitness center were all fine.  The fitness center is not big but it looked clean. -newline- They also advertised that the hotel was in "walking distance" to several shopping centers.  One of them (Westfield) was not even opened yet - it's brand new, and only about half the stores are finished so there is not much there.  The other (Howard Hughes Center) was ok and in walking distance, but if you choose to drive there they also charge for parking. -newline- I would not recommend this hotel to anyone unless they are doing business at one of the corporate buildings in the immediate vicinity.  It's just not a fun or scenic place to be for vacation, especially with all the variety LA has to offer.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2009-08-16	1	First, it is noisy.  Rooms come equipped with earplugs for a reason. -newline- Second, they charge $14 a night for parking, not disclosed, even tho none of the other hotels in the area do. -newline- Third, when my plans changed and I was out of my room for two days with a prepaid reservation for four nights, hotel staff stole the property I had left in my room, and re-rented my room, so that when I returned, I had no room!!  NO APOLOGY whatsoever.  No offer of a refund.

I laid down on my side and almost shot my wife off the other side of the bed. -newline-  -newline- Worst of all is that the cost was the same as the resorts at Palm Springs and Lake Arrowhead that we had just stayed at. -newline-  -newline- Needless to say, my wife has fired me from making future hotel reservations. -newline-  -newline- Kind of a depressing end to an otherwise awesome California vacation.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>

The common areas such as the lobby, pool, and corridors were clean and spacious and gave a feeling of luxury.  The rooms were clean and comfortable with nice bathrooms.  Only negative was that the toilet ran and made noise during the night.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2007-06-23	5	We didn't like the fact that the buffet was the only breakfast option. If you are in a hurry or if you don't want a big breakfast, the $30 buffet is not good. The hotel could really benefit from having a few eateries on site--like having a regular-sized Starbuck instead of a Starbucks cart.   The beds were very comfortable--we loved them.   The staff varied from a couple of very nice and very helpful guys to a check-out guy who couldn't say two words to us.    Overall it was good value for the money and it's location near to the airport suited our very limited time schedule.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6161 West Centinela Avenue, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Culver City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90230-6306</span>

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Los Angeles - Westside		2007-06-06	4	The bad news is that this hotel's  nearly swastica-shapped piscine lacks lane-lines, a major pitfall for seirious lap-swimmers or the inevitable paddlers immersed in in all such chlorinecentric refuges from global warming.    The good news is that as a lapswimmer, I rarely needed to dodge a paddler while in that pool.

Close to Beverly hills, Weho and UCLA where we attended a concert. -newline- The rooftop pool was also awesome. Sipping on cappuccinos in the morning while chilling by the pool and all of that with a Hollywood sign view. -newline- The points to improve are: -newline- -Room cleanliness. Let me explain, the room was very clean when we go there, but once inside the room, the daily service would be bare minimum (making the bed and re-hanging towels). -newline- - Rooftop bar service. I know you guys are packed, but waiting 40 minutes for a cappuccino is not an option. -newline-  -newline- I would definitely come back here!

Hotel Wilshire a Kimpton Hotel		2012-04-22	2	The amenities that were advertised by the hotel were not available as described (e.g. there was no breakfast served at the said location, and no signs to point to some alternate location). It may just be me having used to sleep on memory foam bed and pillow, but I found the bed (hard, spring) and pillows (feather) very uncomfortable. Tap water was not really drinkable due to all chlorine content, while this isn't hotel's fault, not addressing this by simply having bottled water available in the rooms could have been a simple mitigation to the issue. -newline- On the other hand, clean rooms, ok location, nice restaurant at the roof were positive points. Rooms have a nice TV, along with (almost) every possible way to connect your electronic devices, alarm clock (iHome), coffee machine and a safe.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">6317 Wilshire Boulevard, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90048</span>

Luxe City Center Hotel		2013-09-30	4	If you want a really nice hotel that is central to LA Live and several other downtown venues, try Luxe City Center Hotel. The JW Marriott and Ritz Carlton prices were sky high. Luxe City Center was much more reasonable, yet still very luxurious and top notch on service. We have no complaints. It was a great stay with a beautiful modern room, high end linens and a rainshower shower head. Connectivity to the TV was great. We hooked up a laptop with an HDMI cable and watched our Slingbox remotely. I love the high tech nature of the easy connectivity for their large flat screen TV. We easily walked to LA Live for dinner and then to the Orpheum for a show. The cab ride back from the Orpheum was only $5.25 plus tip. Easy, fun night.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1020 S Figueroa Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90015</span>

Luxe City Center Hotel		2013-08-14	4	We moved to this hotel after a disappointing night a mile away. We came in for a show at the Staples Center, so this location was perfect for us. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful. However, the wait staff at the patio restaurant was disappointing. I had to go and get my own drinks/food from the bar as no one bothered to wait on me. It was kinda strange. Food was good and it was lovely to sit out there in the evening. The room was clean and modern. Although In the morning we could hear every word of our neighbors convo, so the walls were quite thin. The bed was really comfy, so we had a restful nights sleep. Valet was responsive but be aware parking was $40/night. Overall a good stay for us.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1020 S Figueroa Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90015</span>

Luxe City Center Hotel		2013-07-29	3	when we first arrived, we pulled up to valet. I expected $20 , it was $40. That is really high to me. As a hotel guest, we should of got a little break. When we proceeded to enter the hotel, the appearance was great. Looked nice and clean. Upon arrival at the desk, the man wasn't so thrilled we were there. Just blah service. He also was a little rude when my fiance asked a question. A little snappy. With a high traffic, prime location hotel, you would think you would want top notch service. They allowed us to check in 40 min early, but the second room wasnt ready, no biggie. The staff that was cleaning the rooms were nicer than the man Steve up front. I am very big on customer service, and this location lacked this. Other than that, a little too pricey, but great location. If the service was over the top I wouldnt mind paying the $.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1020 S Figueroa Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90015</span>

Went to CA to attend a conference at the Nokia Live Theater. Hotel was across the street. Couldn't have asked for a better hotel location. Was also able to schedule a half-day tour through the hotel and the folks came to the hotel to pick us up and take us to the tour bus location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1020 S Figueroa Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90015</span>

Luxe City Center Hotel		2008-02-26	2	This was not the top of the line Holiday Inn and it should be.  The staff provided timely service but they were not always accurate or friendly.  They will help arrange rides and provide wake up calls, even though those calls come in 10-15 minutes later than the request.      Two major problems to look out for.  The sheets cause skin to become red and chaffed so I would recommend bringing your own pillow cases.      Priority Club members do NOT get anything for breakfast and must pay a restaurant fee.  They were to give a 5% discount in the restaurant to Priority members but failed to do so until I requested it at checkout.  The menu is the same as all other Holiday Inns so you are paying for nothing special.        The overall cleanliness could have been up a notch and the amenities in the bathroom were almost nonexistent.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1020 S Figueroa Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90015</span>
Luxe City Center Hotel		2007-12-05	2	The carpet was extremely dirty with many spots.      The first night I found to be a little chilly.  The heating system did not go on when I turned it on.  I called the desk for help.  I was informed that some one would be sent up.  No one ever came and I did not call again.      On my third night I could not sleep due to the extremely loud blaring of the TV in a room next to my room.  I called the desk and asked that someone  talk to the occupant of this room.  The blaring continued for a long time after my desk call.  I finally got up and found a pair of earplugs in my suitcase.  Using the earplugs was of some help in sleeping.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">1020 S Figueroa Street, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90015</span>
Luxe City Center Hotel		2007-06-17	5	I picked this Holiday Inn primarily due to the convenient location to Staples Center.  But I found that our stay was very comfortable, valet parking made things very easy, the staff was friendly.  The room is pretty standard but had all the comforts we needed, like a comfortable bed and nice pillows!  Staples Center is pretty much right across the street so that made it extra easy for us before and after the event.

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2014-05-03	4	This is a nice little gem of a hotel. Its main selling point is the location: right on Wilshire in one of the nicest sections of LA (just outside of Beverly Hills itself, next to the LA Country Club). It has parking (for a fee) but I took the bus everywhere (the 7-day TAP card is highly recommended). It is a block from a Metro Rapid bus stop so getting places was relatively easy. The only downside to the location is that it is surrounded by luxury apartment towers and there isn't even a convenience store within a mile so you need to bring provisions back to your room (they have a tiny gift shop "alcove") or pay for room service or take the rapid bus one stop to Westwood Village. By the way, all rooms have a kitchenette with rudimentary pots and plates. The restaurant is small, pricey, limited menu, but the food is good. The pool is a real selling point. Big, heated, yet hardly used. Note to families: there is no lifeguard and there is nothing else offered in the hotel for children. My room was not very modern but it was clean. Please know that some rooms (mine for example) require climbing a few stairs. If this is a problem (wasn't for me) there are rooms that do not involve stairs. There is a fancy spa in the hotel but I never used its services (massages, facials, etc.) If you want an attractive little hotel in one of the safest and most centrally-located areas of LA for a reasonable price, then this is your hotel. If you want a big, glitzy hotel with shops inside and/or nearby and multiple restaurants/cafes as well, book yourself into the Beverly Hilton, but be prepared to pay a lot more.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2014-03-26	3	I like the hotel & my room a lot. When I arrived I pulled in front & asked the valet where I should park. He was a very nice guy and told me that I could use the garage, but for a fee. Turns out the free is the same whether you valet or not, $28 a night! It added $56 to my hotel stay. I enjoyed the hotel & staff a lot, but would have liked some warning about the parking.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2014-02-17	5	I was taking 2 teenagers to see LA for the first time, so we needed to be centrally located, and in a safe, nice location. This place fit the bill perfectly . We got a really good deal, and an upgraded room so we got a suite with a king size bed, and a love seat big enough to slurp on in the living room. The girls got the bed and I slept on the couch, which was fine. The hotel itself is quite magnificent. There were LOTS of stairs though, to get to our room. Hot tub was close by, but the pool was a hike, but at least it was heated! Downside is that you have to pay $28 per day to park and $10 per day extra for Internet .	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2014-01-02	5	Love love love this gem of a hotel. We were upgraded to a suite for our 4 day stay. At first we were disappointed that we had no view and needed to walk up some stairs to get to our updated suite but it proved to be perfect. There was a great hottub one level down which we enjoyed using. I got to set by the beautiful pool for only a half hour one day and that was gorgeous. It was quiet and off the beaten path with a back gate to exit to the street where we parked our car for free. Room service menu is very cheap. The Gym is fabulous. The suite was beautifully appointed with monogrammed bathrobes and slippers, fabulous linens, sheets changed every day. It was meticulously clean, freshly painted and beautifully decorated in Hollywood style. The staff was friendly, professional and efficient. -newline- I can't wait to stay there again, Rodeo drive is a 15-20 minute walk away.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2014-01-02	5	This is what I describe as a "Look no further Hotel" Beautiful, comfortable, friendly (If I were to find any negative I would like to see reception staff smile a little more ) Charming restaurant, delightful pool area and stylish furnishings. We upgraded to a luxury suite and it was worth every penny to be located around the pool area. Beautiful fully fitted kitchen (tea-towel would have been useful ) Would recommend the homes of the stars bus tour,great fun and good value and a visit to the westwood memorial gardens on Glendon (20minute walk left outside hotel)a must! One of the most tranquil places I have ever visited. Will definately be returning to the Plaza!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2013-12-10	4	I was impressed with the hotel and staff. We enjoyed our stay. My concerns relate to charging for the internet and then not having the ability to access. The hotel staff did credit our account but I would like to have wireless provided free of charge. Also, parking was -newline- an issue. The hotel does not provide services for hearing impaired guests. There is no flashing lights for emergencies.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2013-11-17	3	Spent 10 days there while in L.A. on business. Very convenient for a solitary business traveler (less so for families). Clean room. Hotel is very well situated if attending meetings in Century City, Hollywood, Santa Monica. Free parking across the street. Friendly staff. Beware the long stair climb -- no elevators beyond the second floor. So, if you can't climb stairs, this place is not for you. Otherwise, I would recommend it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2013-11-07	4	Very convenient for my business. -newline- What I hate is to have to pay $10 on the top of $260 for Internet.

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2013-11-07	4	Great location, nice little boutique hotel ‚Ä¶ a bit old but nice. Got a great rate (around $150 per night) but the problem is the daily parking and internet fees are high, which really increases your total room price ‚Ä¶ Other than these extra charges, good little hotel in wonderful location between Beverly Hills and Westwood/Santa Monica.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2013-09-29	3	It seemed awesome. The entrance is really beautiful but the rooms weren't that great. -newline- There's an expensive area with nicer rooms and the rest are inn looking ones, not worth the money at all -newline- That staff wasn't very helpfull either and parking costs too much.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2013-09-09	5	We booked this hotel very last minute, and the staff was very accommodating. We were upgraded in the room, which was nice, the pool was warm and inviting.

Definitely recommend.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2013-07-04	5	I can't believe this hotel is only three stars. I would choose this hotel over 4 and 5 stars any day (and I did, I chose not to stay at the Beverly Hilton because it was too "Beverly Hills" for me). I plan to make this my hotel for all future visits to LA. I loved the beautiful elegance. Every room is a suite. Outside my door was a tropical garden and fish pool. Close by was an intimate jacuzzi that was not next to the swimming pool which made it perfect for quiet dips. The outdoor swimming pool was surrounded by a beautiful garden with classical music pumped in. Wireless is available for $10 a day (worth it). There's a spa and a hair salon. I was in paradise. The staff was spectacular. Treated me like a queen. The restaurant is small and intimate, but elegant and the food was great, though the menu is limited. I travel fairly often and I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I just loved it! I was on business but I sure wished my husband was with me.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2013-05-19	3	I loved the hotel it's so calm and quiet, the location is a bit far from the Rodeo and the price of car parking is expensive.   	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2013-03-18	4	Great value for a little taste of charming retro Beverly Hills glam. Stayed in a junior suite. Big room with fully stocked kitchenette. Spotless. Plush spa robe & slippers. Super friendly, accommodating staff. Fabulous bed.Excellent food. Downsides: No room service after 9 PM. Paper-thin walls.

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2012-11-20	4	We stayed 4-nights at the Beverly Hills Plaza. The check-in process went smooth and we were upgraded to a larger room (I assume because it was a very quiet time of year). -newline-  -newline- The hotel is located on Wilshire Blvd which is SUPER close to the "action" of Beverly Hills but far enough away that you can relax, too! -newline-  -newline- Parking is expensive but convenient. Instead of using valet and having them expect a tip each time they get your car, right around the corner is a private, gated parking lot. Swipe your card and you get instant access. It is safe and secure. -newline-  -newline- The cleaning staff didn't impress me but we did always have fresh towels each afternoon when we returned. The rooms were a decent size and it was nice to have flat screens in the rooms to relax and catch up on the day. -newline-  -newline- The restaurant on site is expensive .. yes, even more expensive than the places to eat IN Beverly Hills. It is convenient, however, and the food was okay. -newline-  -newline- Overall, we enjoyed this hotel and plan on staying there again in the future.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2012-03-16	4	I liked the intimacy of this hotel, staff was great, place was clean and relatively quiet. I stayed for two nights and felt very safe.

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2012-03-12	4	This hotel wasn't bad for the price. The location was not ideal, it was in between BH and Westwood. Walking to either took a good 20 minutes so it is best to have a car (which costs 30/day to park). Rooms were fine. The walls were a little thin so I could hear people in other rooms. The amenities were great, no complaints there. The staff was also great and very helpful. Bottom line: good hotel if you are looking to avoid paying Bevery Hills rates but still want a decent hotel in a decent location.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2011-06-18	1	High expectations based on marketing and past reviews.

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2010-12-10	5	It is very nice, comfortable, and not like a chain hotel at all.  Moreover, not only did some of the staff remember me from a visit a year ago, but I saw a number of other customers remarking about their earlier visits, recalling several staff by name. I really like the ambience of the annex, with the waterfall and large tropical plants among the comfortable guest rooms.

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2010-10-17	5	The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was clean and very spacious.

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2010-10-07	5	Excellent, well located hotel. Newly renovated lobby, fitness center and spa. Rooms are maintained excellently by a friendly staff.

I was there for bussinrss therefore I need my cell phone to be working which it ALWAYS has great reception except in this hotel for some reason. Called the front desk to tell them and they knew already that cell phones don't work there and told me if I stand on the street outside the hotel it should work! I'm like are you serious right now!? Then the staff were very rude unfriendly not helpful and condisending even the manager when I spoke with her to pay yo extend my room because I had more bussinrss. Also parking is rediculas at $28 a day! I would never stay here again!

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2010-06-13	2	Initially upon check in, they have no record of reservation. After showing copies of reservation and waiting 25 mins., they come up with a room. Lug our luggage on a circuitous path, up stairs to our room. Room nice enough with convenient kitchenette. Absolutely worst part was NOISE from neighbors.Awake until after 3 am the first night with loud talking from one room and kept awake the third night until 4:30 am with partying and talking and people trying to get in our adjoining door from the other side. Walls so thin you could absolutely hear everything from adjoining rooms and made for very little rest. Therefore, I would recommend another hotel unless you are very hard of hearing.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

We arrived late and was taken care of the beds were turned down and lights on.  We had a junior Executive suite with a kitchenette and living area.  The bath was small but nice. There were 2 things that we didn't like one the smell...but for the age of the hotel it was understandable and the location of the room. And second, it was all the end of a hall right on Wilshire but no windows facing the street.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2009-10-03	5	Nice hotel,friendly staff. Got upgraded due to noise from adjoining room (happy with that)great pool area. Bus stop at the front door so it made it easy to get around. Hotel arranged a car to take us back to the airport at a very reasonable price. Would stay here again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2009-09-23	5	Even though it is quite a maze getting from the lobby to your room with your baggage. Everything else was great once we were settled in.

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2009-09-17	5	I was visiting LA for business. Here are my complaints: -newline- ‚Ä¢  Didn't like the fact that I had to pay $15 a day to use the internet service--this should be part of the room package, as it is with many hotels. -newline- ‚Ä¢ The TV reception wasn't great either, although I didn't watch much anyway. Crummy selection of OnDemand movies. -newline- ‚Ä¢ The whirlpool was never very hot -newline-  -newline- The hotel was quiet and well-maintained, my room was great, loved the mini-kitchen.  My bathroom was very small, but the shower was hot and had great pressure.  The pool was always the perfect temperature, and a good size for doing laps.  The staff was very pleasant.  Did not get a chance to use the restaurant.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2009-08-30	4	One of the best of the 7 hotels in USA we stayed in over last 6.5 weeks. Good position for Beverley Hills as good Wilshire Blvd bus (bus stop at door) to Rodeo drive and Santa Monica beach only $1.25. Nice small restaurant at hotel but pity no other eating places nearby. We were leaving on 11.30pm flight to Australia and hotel kindly allowed us to use pool after check out at 12 noon but no pool rest room showers. However we recommend this hotel	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2009-08-30	4	The hotel has a very impressive, newly remodeled entrance when you first pull up. The staff was very friendly and helpful and my room was clean. The hotel is located on Wilshire Blvd in Beverly Hills but its at least six or seven long blocks from any coffee shop, store or any real shopping areas. The area is really residential and quiet. Please consider driving or renting a car for convenience when staying here. The hotel has two sides, one has elevators and overlooks the pool, cabanas and the courtyard while the other side provides only a small maze of staircases to gain access to your room and I found this side to be somewhat secluded. Definitely find out what side of the hotel your room is on before booking. I was overall satisfied with my experience but would probably stay in Century City next time and be close to shopping and other conveniences.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2009-08-28	5	This hotel was great.  The staff was extremely friendly and the rooms were a great size.  It is definitely an older hotel though and getting to your room can be tricky (I went up one floor then had about 5 sets of "mini" stairs) so if you have a lot of luggage you should get some help!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2009-08-04	4	On the positive side: We were in town for a  wedding, and this hotel was close to all events. which was very important to us.  The pool is nice and there was a spa hot tub right outside our room.  the rooms are quiet and clean.  The valet parking was easy to use and the drivers were always courteous, helpful, and friendly.  On the other hand ... not so much with the front desk workers (although one young lady was very nice) - these people tended to be rude and somewhat snobby-acting.  The fees for internet service were not explained and it is very easy to just log-in without knowing you're being charged.  Bathrooms are very small and cramped.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2009-07-13	3	My husband and I stayed the night befoe he had to go in to a local hospital for surgery.    When I checked in they noted that I pre-paid with orbitz and therefore I didn't get the best room location. I stayed on a few extra nights.  Room was adaquate, however there was no elevator up to the floor that we were on.  The bathroom was extremely small and the lighting was poor.  Other than that the room was clean and the staff was friendly.  The hotel was re-doing the front entrance to the hotel so you have to be careful going in.  Also parking was $20 a night, but some the hotels I checked was more.  Also, I was missing an article of clothing when I packed to leave.  I asked the front desk to check with housekeeping, they coould not seem to find it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2008-10-26	4	The Beverly Hills Plaza is very nice hotel for the price and locaation. Most of the service was good. The major issue is with the comfort of the bed. The bed matress is the most uncomfortable I have ever slept on. It was extemely hard and appears to be very old. In addition, they need to replace the two small pillows they provide for sleeping and a very outdated comforter.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2008-10-19	5	I was very impressed with the accommodations. We had a one-bedroom suite with a full kitchen and dining area at an excellent price. I brought my grandson to see UCLA and go to a football game. The hotel is very close to Westwood. My only negative comment is the TV reception was not great and when we tried to watch a pay-per-view movie the system was not available.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2008-09-26	2	The hotel is undergoing renovations. We were not aware of this. When we arrived there were construction trucks parked in the front blocking easy access. Also, the resteraunt was closed and the only eating facility was a small temporary resteraunt with five small tables. It was the same kitchen used for room service with a limited menu. The resteraunt closed at 9:00p. Additionally, you were not walking distance to anything.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2008-09-20	5	This was an amazing experience!!! Our room was huge! It didn't feel like a hotel room. It felt more like a condo or apartment. Our room had a living room, a small dining room, and a bedroom. Each time i walked in the door i felt like i was walking into a home. Instead of the traditional hotel room( two beds..a tv in the middle... a bathroom on the right..and a small balcony!!!) it actually felt like you were coming into the comfort of a condo.  Great experience. Great staff. The pool was relaxing! Close proximity to Rodeo drive. Highly recommend this place for it's price and it's proximity to attractions!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2008-09-18	5	All I can really say is .....WOW.  The room was wonderful, the staff accomidating the breakfast great, the pool was amazing (even though I did not get to swim).  We will stay here again. What a wonderful bargain for the money! Living room, kithcen, bathroom, bedroom, balcony, tables by the pool, room servie - You could not have asked for more!	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2008-07-30	5	my sisters and I only stood 1 night we were traveling north and stopping at hotels for 1 or 2 nights at a time. We would of liked to stay longer, we did not get a chance to use any of the amenities. We did however eat diner at the hotel resturant which was very good. We loved the room and the property. We thought the location was a little out of the way from stores etc. overall the hotel was beautiful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>
Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2008-02-10	5	The Beverly Hill Plaza is just miles from Century City, UCLA, and Hollywood. The pool and common areas are beautiful and the beds very comfortable. The only thing I would change is the carpets and bathrooms could stand to be updated.  I would definitely stay there again though.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2007-09-19	4	This hotel was OK.  The room was nice and clean.  Most of the furniture was nice although the coffee table was oddly not, it was old and chipping apart.  The tiling around the hotel also was off - which was not a big deal but just odd.  The staff was fine.  The restaurant closed before I got there at 10:00 PM which was annoying because there is nothing in the neighborhood to run out and get a bite at.  Overall, I give it 3.5-4.0 out of 5 stars.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Beverly Hills Plaza Hotel		2009-10-12	4	Das Hotel ist perfekt gelegen f√ºr Ausfl√ºge nach Santa Monika oder Beverly Hills. Das Hotel liegt direkt am Wilshire Boulevard, dieser f√ºhrt von Santa Monika bis nach Downtown. Ein Leihwagen wird allerdings ben√∂tigt. Busse fahren nur soweit sie wollen und Taxen sind ein echter Gl√ºcksgriff. F√ºr das Valet-Parken fallen pro Tag 2o $ an. Das Hotel selber ist nichts besonderes, allerdings ist es sauber und unser Zimmer war sehr ruhig gelegen.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">10300 Wilshire Blvd., </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Los Angeles</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">90024</span>

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2013-09-19	3	The hotel was clean, both the building and the grounds surrounding it. The location was good if your intent is to visit Universal Studios/Universal City Walk because it is an easy, short walk up the hill. However, overall it is an average, well-maintained property. I personally enjoy walking as much as possible and since it is located on a hill, it is not really conducive to doing a lot of walking. The elevators were slow and I always had to wait despite the fact that there were 5 that went to guestroom floors. I was warned by several other guests that one elevator in particular was "quirky" so I avoided even getting on that one. I did use the business center to check in ahead of time for my outbound flight and the computer & printer were responsive and they do have an onsite person to assist you if needed. There is no fees for use of the business center. The hotel is fairly close to freeway (101), so accessibility is fairly easy.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2013-05-26	5	First off, Los Angeles, as far as I can tell, is a big sprawling mess, so there may not be a good location that puts you near everything. The Hilton in Universal City is reasonably close to the sights we wanted to see, such as Universal Studios, Beverly Hills, and Griffith Park. -newline-  -newline- The hotel room had a king size bed, a desk, refrigerator, and other amenities. The bathroom was a shower/bath with sufficient space that two people could share it without any difficulty. There is a programmable wall safe to hold valuables. -newline-  -newline- We were able to make transportation arrangements through the hotel for pickup at the train station upon our arrival from San Diego, and for our departure via LAX. The hotel concierge will also make arrangements for tours, and will give you comparative prices for transportation to popular destinations. Most cab rides to will cost around $25-30 or a bit more, but the hotel can also make arrangements for a limo or a van to carry you around town. -newline-  -newline- There are a couple of restaurants which are moderately priced, about $15-20, not counting drinks. There is also a coffee bar that serves danish and gelato. -newline-  -newline- The best restaurant we ate at while in LA was in Universal City. This was Tony Roma's a chain devoted to ribs.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2011-12-11	5	Lovely to stay inLA and not need a car. Universal studios a 5 min walk away, and universal citywalk just by the studios, perfect for evening eating. Great choice to suit all. Metro just down the road to access all LA. And, if you feel like being lazy, the shuttle takes you everywhere. Hotel itself excellent. Food looked amazing, but we didn't try. Rooms fabulous with great views. Would def. stay again.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2011-10-07	5	I love staying at the Hilton, this location was perfect, prctically inside the City Walk and Universal Studios Theme Park (walking distance if desired).

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2011-09-22	4	I loved the food (I ordered room service six or seven times in four days! The buffet downstairs was also fabulous!), and the staff were all extremely considerate and professional. The room itself was clean and neat, but it felt way too stuffy (the windows did not open due to safety and building air pressure, and the air conditioner worked fine but all we had to breathe the whole time was recirculated air that was either too hot or too cold... I caught a cold!). The room also had safety and security notices posted all over it... on the back of the door, etc... I started to feel uncomfortable, I didn't think Hollywood was such a high-crime area that we all needed such a plethora of safety and security warnings everywhere. Made it a bit harder to relax. Overall nice place, though.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2011-06-09	5	This was my first time traveling to Los Angelos and I really enjoyed my stay because of the Hilton. The service was fast and the staff was very friendly. The room was clean and if I needed anything they would have it up to my room in no time. I would recommend anyone who is thinking Bout stYing in the universal city area to stay here. They have a free shuttle that comes and goes every 10 mins from the hotel so you do not have to have a taxi. The only warning I have is to have a lot of money for food because their dinning menu is very expensive. Their breakfast buffet was $22. This definitely one of the best Hiltons I have stayed at.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>

Universal City Walk and easy stroll from the hotel when those shuttles aren't running.  Noticed we only had decaf coffee one day, and the fully leaded was delivered in minutes after a call to the front desk.  Lobby Starbucks makes a terrific mocha, and the hot pastry stuffed with potatoes or meat makes a good quick breakfast for those not into the big buffet.

Room was clean and the bed was convertible. If I had a gripe to say, is that the TV is becoming dated and the TV check-out didn't seem to work. Other than that - I loved it!

We chose it because we were going to a concert at the Gibson Amphitheatre, and it was perfect for that. The hotel was marvellous, and the staff a bit too helpful, [...]!

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2010-08-03	4	having stayed in motels for most of my trip i was sad that the hilton, as the most expensive by far, was the only one that charged for basic things like wifi access, parking etc. also the room wasn't as clean as some i'd seen in motels along the route. but it wasn't horrendous either, it was perfectly adequate.  and the location is excellent if you want to "do" hollywood - they have free shuttles to universal studios, and hollywood itself is very close by. if you want to see everything in hollywood the location couldn't be better. but i expected better from a megabucks chain like this.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2010-06-11	4	Whenever I stay for business in Los Angeles, I look to stay at the Hilton Universal City.  It is centrally located for me in terms of my travel plans with clients.  It is also ideal for leisure travel with the City Walk and Universal Studios right onsite.  The staff are always warm, friendly and wonderful (my old friend, Alberto, has been with the wait staff at the Hilton's hotel restuarant ever since I can remember -- a testament to how much Hilton values quality people.)  The rooms are quite nice with plenty of amenities (fresh fruit and free bottled water each day are nice treats).  The price is a bit imposing at times, so I try to come during weekdays when rates are not quite so steep.  I highly recommend it.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>
Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2010-04-11	4	Over all was really great.  However, buffet was not very good for the price charged. Food was not hot and never is with buffet. Selection not very good for people who do not like sushi. Very little meat selection. Lots of seafood selection, but not very good. If you drink expect to pay dearly for those drinks, they are quite pricey, but to be expected for the location and quality of hotel. I would bring a microwave if you plan on eating in. You can get a comp refrigerator.  Pet friendly but $75 for the stay. If you plan on bringing your pet don't expect a room with a view. Pet owners are relagated to the 2nd floor below the lobby. You pay $9.95 a day for the luxary bedding whether you want it or not.  Unexpected cost until reservation was made. If you make online, read the fine print.  Will probably stay somewhere else next time we come down. Would like to be treated with a little more respect as a responsible pet owner. Expect to pay a minimum of $10 tip for services provided by bellpersons and to Vallai persons parking.  Vallai parking was worth the price paid per night, which to me was worth it to not have to hassle parking the car ourselves and having the convenice of loading the car right in front rather than drag it on several trips to the self parking garage. Staff was very friendly and helpful.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>

The hotel was great and very friendly atmosphere but thought it was a little costly for the room we had. I do travel around and have stayed at hotels that have the same setup for a lot less.  I did like that they provide shuttles and this was a plus but had to find out on our own. It would be nice to know that the staff would have informed us of the shuttles when we arrived.

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2009-06-19	5	The hotel was great.  It is right up the hill from the Universal City Red line Metro station, which will take you through Hollywood and into downtown.  There is an In-n-Out down the street within walking distance, and the area is very safe.  The hotel is right across from City Walk, much closer than the nearby Sheraton. -newline-  -newline- The only negative is that it sits atop a very steep hill, which is tough to walk up.  Luckily, a shuttle runs that will take you to City Walk, and you can cross to the hotel there.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2009-01-02	4	We found this hotel to be very good in general. However, we were disappointed with the response for the maintenance issues. The bathrom shower water was consistently luke warm. Reuested the hotel staff to address this issue but till the last day this issue was not fixed and hotel did not suggest any alternate options. A good hotel would go an entra mile to make sure that the customer is satisfied, but in this case it appear to fall on deaf ears.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2008-09-07	5	My wife and I stayed over night at this hotel to celebrate 10 years of marriage. The hotel room was great with a amazing view. It is walking distance to the Univaersal city walk. The room service food was suprisingly good, and the matinee show of WICKED topped off a great weekend.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>
Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2008-09-07	5	I chose this hotel for my senior citizen parents who wanted to attend the Hollywood Bowl, but did not want to drive home afterwards so late at night.      The hotel was easy to get to, a little intimidating for them because it was so big, but the front desk staff was very accommodating and one clerk even took the time to escort my parents to the elevators and explain the key for elevator access.  My folks were staying on a concierge floor, but they didn't need any concierge service.  However, they had access to the continental breakfast the next day, which was wonderful (I didn't stay with them, but the concierge invited me to have breakfast with them).  I would recommend this hote for its service.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>
Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2008-09-01	4	I have stayed at the hotel before in rooms that are more updated.   The rooms had flat screen tvs.   Our room had an old tv in the old style entertainment center, and the sound on the tv was distorted some of the time.   That was a little disappointing but the overall stay was nice.   Next time I will ask for an upgraded room.   The location in Burbank is great.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>
Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2008-07-22	5	I would totally recommend this hotel to anyone that will be going to Universal Studios.

Hilton Los Angeles--Universal City		2007-06-18	5	This was my second stay at the Hilton Universal and I find it both comfortable and very clean.  View is excellent.  Items in the mini bar did seem a little stale.  I love having the desk to work on.  Couldn't get my laptop to work there and bell hop didn't seem that informed but I never called down for further assistance.  Could have used more hangers in the closet.  Overall it did contain most of what you need to be comfortable and breakfast was very good.	<span itemprop="streetAddress">555 Universal Hollywood Drive, </span><span itemprop="addressLocality">Universal City</span>, <span itemprop="addressRegion">CA</span> <span itemprop="postalCode">91608-1001</span>
