make_dataset makes a dataset from the csv file. 
it returns two lists: a list with the targets and a list with the tokenized reviews. Each sentence has its own list in the reviews
Dataset structure: [[[sentence 1 in review1], [sentence 2 in review 1] ...], [[sentence 1 in review 2], [sentence 2 in review 2] ...] ...]
The reviews are first sentence-tokenized and then word-tokenized. 

Remarks: 
-newline- is in the tokenized text, to show newlines. Should we remove those?
Punctuation is in separate tokens.
Contractions are tokenized like this: ['did','n't']
